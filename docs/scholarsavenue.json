The saga of waking up just 5 minutes before class is an everlasting one with consequences that might lead to cycle collisions thanks to some of the new changes in rules around here. But for what it's worth, the IIT tag looms large before you and you might as well put these things at the back of your mind.\nBut there are some things we do look forward to. Scaling the peak of the most coveted institute in the world, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is everybody's dream. Getting admission into MIT is an objectively quantified pinnacle of achievement. \n\nWell, that explains the rat race we were put into from a very young age, right? It means that we, with our degrees and achievements, are the ones who are capable of following this road. \nOr does it?\n\nHere is a story that will shatter such narrow conceptions and hopefully rekindle the fire for 'learning' within you. The most important thing in one's life is to question everything and set upon a journey to find the answers. The present system of education is stuck in a deep quagmire of controversy, but in the end it is the passion and interest of a person that will actually propel him/her forward.\n\nRead about the inspiring story here: http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/17-year-old-unschooled-mumbai-girl-malvika-joshi-makes-it-to-mit/story-EQxDf2NFS5TReDc6Ix3iEJ.html", "id": "156819310131_10154364477985132"}, {"pic": null, "created_time": "2016-08-29T12:19:01+0000", "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-assembly-passes-resolution-for-states-name-change/article9045696.ece", "message": "The West Bengal Legislative Assembly on Monday passed a resolution changing the name of the State to Bengal in English and Bangla in Bengali. \n\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-assembly-passes-resolution-for-states-name-change/article9045696.ece", "id": "156819310131_10154359701680132"}, {"pic": null, "created_time": "2016-08-29T12:19:01+0000", "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-assembly-passes-resolution-for-states-name-change/article9045696.ece", "message": "The West Bengal Legislative Assembly on Monday passed a resolution changing the name of the State to Bengal in English and Bangla in Bengali. \n\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-assembly-passes-resolution-for-states-name-change/article9045696.ece", "id": "156819310131_10154359701680132"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.294184150131.193021.156819310131/10154357500290132/?type=3", "id": "156819310131_10154357508160132", "pic": "10154357500290132.png", "created_time": "2016-08-28T17:27:27+0000", "story": "The Scholars' Avenue added 4 new photos.", "message": "AIESEC IIT Kharagpur in collaboration with Gopali Youth Welfare Society organized a social event in JVM, a school run by GYWS.
