A recent culmination of \ntheir extensive efforts has taken the form of their latest project, K4, the sixth creation of Team KART.\n\nThe bay visit was particularly conducted to showcase their latest endeavour. Commencing from scratch, Team KART first simulates a new project before constructing a CAD model of the project. The created model is then subjected to analysis validations before a blueprint is ready to be given for manufacturing. Team KART also specializes in in-house manufacturing. The fuel tank, chassis structures, pedal box and rockers are solely manufactured by Team KART itself.\n\nThe recently concluded project of K4 focusses primarily to refine and enhance speed and drivers\u2019 safety. To facilitate attainment of high speed, it utilises light and durable body of carbon fibre, in addition to 13-inch untreated race tyres and limited slip-type differentials and eccentric differential mounts which facilitates ease of use and reduces the weight. Besides this, Team KART has also conceptualized and manufactured a contraption of its own to calculate and digitally display engine RPM and temperature of the engine. Ultimately, safety does not come with luck, it has to be prepared. K4 is deemed safe for a driver and has gone through The Mechanical Endurance Test adjudging the safety guidelines of the project. K4 endured the technical scrutiny, emerging as one of the sixteen teams to effectively clear three rounds of mechanical inspection test, tilt test and noise test out of participation of 70 teams.\n \nThe Bay Visit facilitated students to know more about this vibrant research group, appreciate their sincere and stoic efforts, and interact with the team, which, since its inception in 2008, has persevered in the field of automotive engineering. Students, bubbling with enthusiasm, were explained the CAD model of K4, working of the project and simulations by an equally enthusiastic team. K4 had also participated in Formula Bharat 2019 at Coimbatore hosted by Mobility Engineering Consortium Pvt.

He had a lot of interesting things to say on this front and much more.\n\nCheck out the link below to share some of his thoughts on several topics ranging from intrepreneurship, free Wi-Fi to how Google shaped him into what he is today.\n\n https://youtu.be/69NctEpzNUI", "created_time": "2018-02-12T15:39:31+0000", "pic": null}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.10151912978410132.1073741840.156819310131/10155958712115132/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/27907615_10155958712115132_3229864701552313871_o.jpg?oh=62a7c45037eda28fdac9b6af958bcd55&oe=5B072BBB", "id": "156819310131_10155958712115132", "message": "\"People often say that motivation doesn't last.

The project to develop a pilot for NDLI was also awarded to IIT Kharagpur which was completed well before the scheduled time. This is the primary reason why IIT Kharagpur was awarded the second phase. Visit https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/ to register and have a look at the beta version of NDLI.\n\nPhase-II of the project aims to develop the Pilot to a full-fledged NDLI with an aim to build a National Asset. This project will enable some key national knowledge discovery and immersive learning platforms built around the Digital Library. It will also encourage the entrepreneurial development of tools and apps around this platform. In its final contour, the system may serve as a pan-India virtual teaching-learning-evaluation-knowledge discovery and innovation platform, evolving as a key National Asset.\n    \nNDLI is getting structured along verticals like School, Competitive Exams and Career Development, Engineering, Medical, Law, etc. Under the Competitive Exams & Career Development vertical, NDLI is going to make available solutions (with explanations, alternate solutions, reference study materials and annotations) to all IIT-JEE Question Papers (since 2007) to benefit a large number of IIT-JEE aspirants.\n\nThe project is, thus, inviting applications from students who are currently in their 1st year of studies (Engineering, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics) and are willing to work as part-time Intern to prepare Solutions for JEE Question Papers.

Fondly remembered by many students and admirers.\n\nAmherst - Madhukar Anant Rege passed away at age 92, on September 20th, 2016, after a long illness and a long, full life on three continents.\n\nBorn in Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast of India, he had a happy, active childhood. From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning.\n\nIt was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning.\n\nIn 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty.\n\nHe was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness.\n\nHe leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States. A great loss to us all, but a life well lived.\n\nBeers and Story Belchertown Funeral Home has been entrusted with the arrangements.", "created_time": "2016-09-28T13:52:36+0000", "story": "The Scholars' Avenue shared Director IIT Kharagpur's photo."}, {"id": "156819310131_10154446039510132", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.294184150131.193021.156819310131/10154446039510132/?type=3", "message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.
