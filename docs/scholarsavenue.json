A recent culmination of \ntheir extensive efforts has taken the form of their latest project, K4, the sixth creation of Team KART.\n\nThe bay visit was particularly conducted to showcase their latest endeavour. Commencing from scratch, Team KART first simulates a new project before constructing a CAD model of the project. The created model is then subjected to analysis validations before a blueprint is ready to be given for manufacturing. Team KART also specializes in in-house manufacturing. The fuel tank, chassis structures, pedal box and rockers are solely manufactured by Team KART itself.\n\nThe recently concluded project of K4 focusses primarily to refine and enhance speed and drivers\u2019 safety. To facilitate attainment of high speed, it utilises light and durable body of carbon fibre, in addition to 13-inch untreated race tyres and limited slip-type differentials and eccentric differential mounts which facilitates ease of use and reduces the weight. Besides this, Team KART has also conceptualized and manufactured a contraption of its own to calculate and digitally display engine RPM and temperature of the engine. Ultimately, safety does not come with luck, it has to be prepared. K4 is deemed safe for a driver and has gone through The Mechanical Endurance Test adjudging the safety guidelines of the project.

The first session, \"Motivational Lecture-II\" had Dr Era Dutta, a consultant, neuropsychiatrist, therapist, and a life coach from Kolkata involving the students in an interactive talk about Success and Depression. With statistics and examples, the students explored the pervasive traits of depression, its correspondence with success and its cure, the happiness. \"Happiness is the whole pie and we are focusing only on success which is just a small chunk. Why not focus on the whole pie?\", she said. The session thus ended with her advice to this post-millennial audience, which was to keep chanting a happiness mantra, \"Today was a good day.\"\n \nBy 7:15, the strength has already increased to about 300 for the latter event of the day, \"Carrer Workshop-2\" conducted by the External Relations Cell and the CDC. In continuation to the CV filling workshop of last week, this session involved an insight into various opportunities available for an undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. Four sectors viz., Higher Studies, Public Sector, Corporate Sector, and Entrepreneurship sector were discussed. Students were given a rough outline of how it is to choose one of them and implement accordingly a set of plans, internships to do and courses to undertake.

He mentioned that the Assimilation Program was completely different from OP in a sense that all the activities would be monitored and recorded officially. He also spoke about how the app developed exclusively for the purpose of the program would be helpful to the sophomores. In case of any mishaps, all one has to do is post a complaint through the app and the issue would be resolved within 24 hours. He also stressed that the attending the Hall Assimilation is mandatory and one has to submit a written letter of absence to the hall president or the warden in case one misses out due to unavoidable circumstances.\n\nHarsh Kumar Sharan, Deputy Contingent leader of InterIIT Cultural team, gave an introduction about cultural events and our records on the previous two Inter IIT competitions. He also gave an in short note on all the events and how one could get a position for themselves in the Inter IIT contingent. Harsh asked all sophomores present to work on their skills and on a lighter note, he added, \u201cYou can\u2019t become captains in your second year because you suck at everything you do\u201d.\n\nThe session was followed by the general secretaries, sports and games, who gave us an introduction to the sports culture in KGP.

The finals boiled down to a tie-breaker for third place and after three further tie-breaker questions which couldn't break the tie, the third place remained tied till the end in the final result.\nProf. Seema Singh of the HSS department also graced the event with her presence and stayed almost till the end of the quiz.\n\nFirst: Sangeeta Roy, Shubhra Agrawal (225)\nSecond: Ayushi Mrigen, Nikita Gautam, Kavana Rao (135)\nThird: Shubhi Jain, Abhigna Revuru, Nayan Kubade (130) and\nPankhuri Saxena, Samruddhi Pataskar and Pankhudi Jain (130)\nFourth: (125)\nFifth: (120)\n\nThe Scholars' Avenue congratulates the winners and hopes that this helps somewhat bridge the gender disparity in quizzing in the campus and further wishes IIT Kharagpur Quiz Club best of luck for the future quizzes in this event.", "created_time": "2018-03-08T19:11:33+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/28828340_10156038887485132_6362149905804082673_o.jpg?oh=d4998d47fa1b0d581e59b474d8c85da7&oe=5B435E26", "story": "The Scholars' Avenue added 4 new photos.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.294184150131.193021.156819310131/10156038887485132/?type=3", "id": "156819310131_10156038937435132"}, {"message": "India Quiz | Quiz Week: Day 2\n\nDay 2 in the Intra-KGP Quiz Week saw an even higher participation from the KGP population, with similar scenes occurring with first timers as day one.

Established in May 2016 under the mentorship of the Prof Partha P Chakrabarti, Director IIT Kharagpur, and under the charge of Prof Jhareswar Maiti, Head of Department, Industrial and Systems Engineering, the SAVR Lab has state of the art facilities to carry out research in Virtual Reality. The lab is equipped with the essential tools such as 3D laser scanners, military-grade head-mounted displays, oculus rifts, data gloves, powerful computers, projectors etc. The lab has been sponsored by the Government of India under the Uchhatar Avishkar Yojana (UAY) to promote Virtual Reality research.\n \nTheir \u201chero project\u201d, for all the Elon Musk fans out there, is a Virtual Reality [VR] simulation of SpaceX\u2019s Star-man created by Prateek Srivastava [Third-year undergraduate, Department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture]. \n \nA team of 10 students including Manorama Jha[research scholar] and Siddharth Jindal [Third-year undergraduate, Department of Mathematics and Computing]  led by Prateek and mentored by Mr. Anirban Santara [PhD scholar and a 2015 B.Tech graduate, Department of Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering], who is popular in the Artificial Intelligence community of Kharagpur, are working on the Virtual KGP project, a complete open-source VR simulation of the campus which they hope will help in initiating other projects for development of different VR applications. To aid the completion of the project they intend to organize various hackathons where students will be awarded for adding intricate details.

Fondly remembered by many students and admirers.\n\nAmherst - Madhukar Anant Rege passed away at age 92, on September 20th, 2016, after a long illness and a long, full life on three continents.\n\nBorn in Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast of India, he had a happy, active childhood. From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning.\n\nIt was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning.\n\nIn 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty.\n\nHe was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness.\n\nHe leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States. A great loss to us all, but a life well lived.\n\nBeers and Story Belchertown Funeral Home has been entrusted with the arrangements.", "created_time": "2016-09-28T13:52:36+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14444990_1646951098929315_2732450396443913396_o.jpg", "story": "The Scholars' Avenue shared Director IIT Kharagpur's photo.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/director.iitkgp/photos/a.1460899854201108.1073741828.1455755204715573/1646951098929315/?type=3", "id": "156819310131_10154446112815132"}, {"message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.
