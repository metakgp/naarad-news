In addition to CoEs, the institute has also been accommodated AI and other emerging technology related course. Among the courses offered in the field of AI, the topics include financial analytics, industrial automation, digital healthcare, intelligent transportation system among others. Recently it signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Telangana government to set up its off-campus in the state.                            \n\nApart from that,  The Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Rights (RGSOIPL) in IIT Kharagpur announced that it will offer a one-semester interdisciplinary course titled \u201cArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Law\u201d,  which aims to provoke a rethink on the modes of societal governance and law by AI capabilities.    \n\nComing to corporate partnerships, the Institute on March 28 announced that it will be collaborating with Indian IT giant, Wipro to bolster research in the field of AI and 5G technology. The joint partnership will see Wipro deploying the outcome of the research into their working, while IIT KGP is expected to benefit from the company\u2019s high-end infrastructure and gain more research insight. \u201cThe two organizations will focus on AI research applicable in the healthcare, education and retail sectors as well as in domains such as climate change and cybersecurity. In addition, subject matter experts from Wipro and IIT Kharagpur will promote knowledge sharing through guest lectures, workshops, and seminars on 5G and AI,\u201d Wipro said in a press release.\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the Institute on its efforts and hopes it becomes a frontier of AI in the days to come.\n\nhttps://www.analyticsindiamag.com/how-iit-kharagpur-is-strengthening-its-ai-research-with-the-help-of-its-illustrious-alumni-base/", "created_time": "2019-04-02T15:57:41+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "146188872068143_2305027012850974", "link": "https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/how-iit-kharagpur-is-strengthening-its-ai-research-with-the-help-of-its-illustrious-alumni-base/", "message": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the technology of the moment.

This section of the student population is the most important contributors to the research quality index of the institute. \n\nResearch Scholars' Council had a meeting with the director to discuss the issues pertaining to the research scholars in the campus, the most prominent being request for a hike in fellowship. The director has agreed to forward the collective request of research scholars from IIT Kharagpur to the Ministry of Human Resource and Development. Although the grant for Prime Minister Research Fellows (PMRFs) is considerably higher (INR 70,000 monthly) but they are very less in number. Currently, the Junior Research Fellows (JRFs) receive a fellowship grant of INR 25,000 per month while the Senior Research fellows receive 3,000 more.

S. Jha, Head of the security section, we have got to know about the various measures taken by the security section of IIT Kharagpur to ensure better safety of the students and overall peacefulness on the campus. Some of these measures are:\n1) Installation of over a hundred CCTV cameras across the campus including Halls, exit and entry gates, crossover positions like Tikka and many more. This ensures tracking of the happenings on the campus in a better way and enables the security team to spot the situations where emergency measures are needed to be taken. This would help in cases like cycle thefts, inappropriate incidents etc. A proposal of installing extra three times more the CCTV cameras installed right now is underway and is soon to be procured within next one month. Earlier, Awaaz had communicated the need of CCTV cameras in the campus to the authorities based on our survey on Basic Amenities. And we are happy to see this getting implemented. \n2) Formation of Quick Response Teams (QRTs). There are 4 sets of QRT teams strolling around campus all the time and students, in case of any emergency, can call them 24 x 7 and they would be there to help you out within two to three minutes. QRT team is equipped with motorbikes and wireless sets. QRTs can be called on two numbers: 03222-281002, 03222-281003\n3) Entry Passes for non-IIT students and staffs. Non IIT members now have to take a three month valid entry pass in order to cross through the campus. Once the validity is over, they need to renew the same. Without getting their entry passes checked, they can't go through the gates. \n4) More Wireless sets to security personnel. More than four dozens of Wireless sets have been procured and distributed to security personnel to enable effective communication and hence, quicker actions.\n5) Proposal of Women Cell. A proposal for having Women QRT teams and more women security personnel is underway. \n\nBesides beefing up the security, they have also been actively involved in smooth conduction of Illumination, Durga Puja celebrations and other events happening in the campus. This, for sure, indicates that the security measures have been strengthen over recent months and we hope that it\u2019s going to get better in future.", "created_time": "2018-11-10T06:43:25+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/45748901_2094495570570787_1338070320602415104_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=085babb17ba8b80f6782c6bc3ce7a194&oe=5C835039"}, {"id": "146188872068143_2094512563902421", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505/2094495563904121/?type=3", "message": "Beefed up security on the Campus\nIn a conversation with Mr. S.

This would help in cases like cycle thefts, inappropriate incidents etc. A proposal of installing extra three times more the CCTV cameras installed right now is underway and is soon to be procured within next one month. Earlier, Awaaz had communicated the need of CCTV cameras in the campus to the authorities based on our survey on Basic Amenities. And we are happy to see this getting implemented. \n2) Formation of Quick Response Teams (QRTs). There are 4 sets of QRT teams strolling around campus all the time and students, in case of any emergency, can call them 24 x 7 and they would be there to help you out within two to three minutes. QRT team is equipped with motorbikes and wireless sets. QRTs can be called on two numbers: 03222-281002, 03222-281003\n3) Entry Passes for non-IIT students and staffs. Non IIT members now have to take a three month valid entry pass in order to cross through the campus. Once the validity is over, they need to renew the same. Without getting their entry passes checked, they can't go through the gates. \n4) More Wireless sets to security personnel. More than four dozens of Wireless sets have been procured and distributed to security personnel to enable effective communication and hence, quicker actions.\n5) Proposal of Women Cell. A proposal for having Women QRT teams and more women security personnel is underway. \n\nBesides beefing up the security, they have also been actively involved in smooth conduction of Illumination, Durga Puja celebrations and other events happening in the campus.

Critical analysis of the issues as important as mess and canteens is impossible without the opinion of the student community, hence Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur earnestly requests each and every student to invest a little time for the benefit of everyone.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/Z9rVC9XvGuvsvM2z2", "created_time": "2018-10-10T15:00:19+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "146188872068143_2051201008233577", "link": null, "message": "Results | Eastern Vocals | Open IIT 2018-19\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n1st position: Eeshan Deo \n2nd position: Himanshu Surgade and Sai Srividya\n3rd position: Satyam Tiwari\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the winners.", "created_time": "2018-10-10T09:28:05+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "146188872068143_2051201008233577", "link": null, "message": "Results | Eastern Vocals | Open IIT 2018-19\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n1st position: Eeshan Deo \n2nd position: Himanshu Surgade and Sai Srividya\n3rd position: Satyam Tiwari\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the winners.", "created_time": "2018-10-10T09:28:05+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "146188872068143_2051201008233577", "link": null, "message": "Results | Eastern Vocals | Open IIT 2018-19\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n1st position: Eeshan Deo \n2nd position: Himanshu Surgade and Sai Srividya\n3rd position: Satyam Tiwari\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the winners.", "created_time": "2018-10-10T09:28:05+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "146188872068143_2051201008233577", "link": null, "message": "Results | Eastern Vocals | Open IIT 2018-19\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n1st position: Eeshan Deo \n2nd position: Himanshu Surgade and Sai Srividya\n3rd position: Satyam Tiwari\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the winners.", "created_time": "2018-10-10T09:28:05+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "146188872068143_2050101618343516", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/videos/238590693475273/", "message": "Talk with the Director | Part-2\nAfter the well received and thrilling response over the first session of the Talk with the Director, Awaaz IIT Kharagpur presents its next installment where the Director elaborates over the minimal city life of IIT Kharagpur and his discern over this issue followed by its pro and cons(0:01), his thoughts over the change in the course content that must be implemented to make the students more employable in the industries (3:25) which is followed by the discussion on the freedom given to students to opt for the micro-specialization courses of Industrial Systems and Engineering department(8:03).

Mr. Aneesh Reddy told that \u2018The Aditya Choubey Center for Re-Water Research\u2019 would be networking with the government bodies to take up this technology and the process and meet the water challenge in various cities.

Mr. Niladri Sarkar had claimed himself to pursue MS at Mechanical Engineering Department of IIT KGP and having worked as External Research Associate in the Fluid Dynamics Lab of MIT. He also claimed to be pursuing research at IIT Madras and IIT Bombay at different point of times. A few months ago, when he was in KGP campus, he started approaching faculty members stating that he is an alumnus of IIT KGP and he is willing to collaborate with them for his MIT Project. However, when he was confronted by one of our alumni, Dr. Kaushik Mukherjee on sensing a foul play, he took down most of these claims from social media. Upon contacting the concerned MIT professor, it was also found out that his MIT claim was totally fake. He social engineered his way into IIT KGP. He started adding IITians (and KGPians) to his friend list. Upon seeing a lot of mutual friends, the other students added him. He then approached the junior batches posing himself as an alumnus who was visiting the college on the pretext of meeting some professors and doing research.

These research papers are available within IIT Council, that\u2019s what he has told some people.\n5) A mail from Prof. Indranil Manna, Director, IIT Kanpur praising his research works.\n6) The Research Quality Index certificate stating that he scored 100/100 in research and obtained an AIR 1.

In what can be called as a bold move from the institute administration in curbing such political influence on the mindset of the student populace of IIT Kharagpur, the Dean of Students' Affairs has circulated a mail discouraging any such events which are organized with hidden political motives. He reiterated that tagging the name of IIT Kharagpur in such events which may escalate tension in society in the name of political affiliation, religion, caste and region can not be tolerated. Although he did not mention the extent to which the institute would be considering the severity of political motive, but the statement does send out a message regarding the degree of seriousness with which such detracting events are being taken into consideration by administration. Here is what the mail reads:\n\"It is being observed that some groups with political motivation are organizing some events in IIT Kharagpur but tagging the name of IIT Kharagpur.

Tagore always stayed away from the concept of separatist nationalism and urged the people to get over the narrow differences of casteism and other social evils. \nOn his 157th birth anniversary, paying tribute to the revolutionary thinker, we hope that his ideas of freedom will be realised deeply as our nation progresses.", "created_time": "2018-05-07T11:35:11+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31967930_1836758886344458_7000200598263955456_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=754a67dd73a11a9a1b22cfc9890c8069&oe=5B5597F2"}, {"id": "146188872068143_1835646006455746", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1835643076456039/?type=3", "message": "Charles Dickens once said, \u201cThere is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour.\u201d  \nThrough humour, you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers.

More locations where the cycles would be stationed might be targetted in the future and it is when our campus would truly become easily accessible to everybody. \n\nDetailed features and functioning of the facility and the list of the Ola Parking Zones will follow soon.\nWith this hope and full appreciation to the efforts and success of Mr. Seemant Jay and the Technology Students' Gymkhana, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes everyone happy, safe and easy rides from anywhere to anywhere on this beautiful campus.", "created_time": "2018-05-02T12:38:28+0000", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 3 new photos."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1831701613516852/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31753578_1831701620183518_3976260643664691200_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=c71d876433bee56c22b3e10f6e51085e&oe=5B602502", "id": "146188872068143_1831637850189895", "message": "The beautiful campus of IIT Kharagpur is waiting for you with a slight twist in its flavour. No need, now, to be afoot and toil in the scorching sun or get drained in the rainwater to reach your destination inside the campus. Ola Pedal is here and this has been made possible due to the great efforts of the Technology Students' Gymkhana. Now you can pick up a cycle from any of the 40 locations to any other of these locations including 15 Halls of Residence and 25 other prime locations spanning the beautiful IIT Kharagpur Campus. Using the cycles would cost you INR 5/- for the period of 15 minutes exclusive of taxes and would amount to about INR 6/- for the period including them. Just download the regular Ola Mobile App and you can book the ride, cashless and hassle-free. Scan the QR code at the rear mudguard or the lock module of the cycle with the App and your cycle unlocks, ready to give your hair, the sway in the cool breeze of Kharagpur. You can lock and unlock the cycle anywhere on the campus using the QR code but the ride can be begun or ended at the 40 locations inside the campus only. The service is expected to be fully functional by the 3rd of May 2018.\nMore locations where the cycles would be stationed might be targetted in the future and it is when our campus would truly become easily accessible to everybody.

The team of Abhimanyu Bharade, Baibhab Pattnaik and Harsh Agarwal won the 'India Quiz' in the recently concluded Nihilanth - the Annual Inter IIT-IIM Quiz championship. After registering a thunderous sweeping win in Inter IIT Cultural Meet, their juggernaut went on to register one more victory against a formidable team of IIM Ahmedabad. Last year, they had finished last in the finals of India Quiz but they made amends for the same in the 15th edition of Nihilanth, hosted by IIM Ahmedabad from January 25-28, 2018.

Do you know when was the last time KGP Women\u2019s Basketball team had reached into the finals of Inter IIT Sports Meet? No, you might not be knowing! Let us tell you. It was 2004 and it\u2019s after a gap of 13 years that these girls have repeated the same in style by winning the silver medal with an undefeated run till finals! But this journey has neither been a cakewalk nor they were served it easily on a platter. They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most. \nIn a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn\u2019t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn\u2019t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn\u2019t play. Count goes to 7. One player was in beginning stages and lacked in the experience that it takes to play at bigger stages. Effective count goes to 6. How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? \u201cA basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.\u201d And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters.\n\nIn the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn\u2019t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay\u2019s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments \u2013 the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong. All the practice, hard work and perseverance bore sweet fruits. \nIt wasn\u2019t their victory alone. It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, \u201cWithout his strategies, the victory wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn\u2019t disappoint him. The captain Remee marshalled her troop well and her leadership was the key to this entire campaign. A huge shout to these amazing girls! \nWhat lies in the future? Most of the current players are graduating out. The team needs enthusiastic and dedicated junior players to fill the boots. As one of the players admitted, even during the practice sessions, participation from juniors was very less. They had a hard time choosing 9 players for the tournament. Participation from girls was utterly disappointing. And if that\u2019s what will keep on going, we don\u2019t stand a chance in rewriting histories in the upcoming Sports Meets. The current players have appealed to the girls to participate in as large numbers as possible. The sports scenario in KGP among girls isn\u2019t in very good shape right now. We needed inspirations to look up to. Now that we have some of them, why to wait?
