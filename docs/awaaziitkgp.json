The temperatures that rose gradually through the examination days have been brought down by the relieving heavy downpours in the end. \n\nWell, mid-sems aren\u2019t the only cause of heat, probably end-sems too! Actually, the \u2018Load\u2019 has not only and everything to do with examinations. The myth that \u2018load\u2019 exists only during the exams needs to be busted. Heaviness can come at any point in time and does not always have a major reason. But being vocal and interactive with your friends is the key to feeling better.\n\nKeeping this in mind, this academic session a number of halls have organized cultural events to increasingly socialize the students. The most recent one was Aavhan \u2013 The Cultural Night of RP Hall. The event conducted just a week before the midsems, witnessed wide participation and excitement between students across halls. It had poetry, stand-up, singing along with various other cultural events.

This section of the student population is the most important contributors to the research quality index of the institute. \n\nResearch Scholars' Council had a meeting with the director to discuss the issues pertaining to the research scholars in the campus, the most prominent being request for a hike in fellowship. The director has agreed to forward the collective request of research scholars from IIT Kharagpur to the Ministry of Human Resource and Development. Although the grant for Prime Minister Research Fellows (PMRFs) is considerably higher (INR 70,000 monthly) but they are very less in number. Currently, the Junior Research Fellows (JRFs) receive a fellowship grant of INR 25,000 per month while the Senior Research fellows receive 3,000 more.

S. Jha, Head of the security section, we have got to know about the various measures taken by the security section of IIT Kharagpur to ensure better safety of the students and overall peacefulness on the campus. Some of these measures are:\n1) Installation of over a hundred CCTV cameras across the campus including Halls, exit and entry gates, crossover positions like Tikka and many more. This ensures tracking of the happenings on the campus in a better way and enables the security team to spot the situations where emergency measures are needed to be taken. This would help in cases like cycle thefts, inappropriate incidents etc. A proposal of installing extra three times more the CCTV cameras installed right now is underway and is soon to be procured within next one month. Earlier, Awaaz had communicated the need of CCTV cameras in the campus to the authorities based on our survey on Basic Amenities. And we are happy to see this getting implemented. \n2) Formation of Quick Response Teams (QRTs). There are 4 sets of QRT teams strolling around campus all the time and students, in case of any emergency, can call them 24 x 7 and they would be there to help you out within two to three minutes. QRT team is equipped with motorbikes and wireless sets. QRTs can be called on two numbers: 03222-281002, 03222-281003\n3) Entry Passes for non-IIT students and staffs. Non IIT members now have to take a three month valid entry pass in order to cross through the campus. Once the validity is over, they need to renew the same. Without getting their entry passes checked, they can't go through the gates. \n4) More Wireless sets to security personnel. More than four dozens of Wireless sets have been procured and distributed to security personnel to enable effective communication and hence, quicker actions.\n5) Proposal of Women Cell. A proposal for having Women QRT teams and more women security personnel is underway. \n\nBesides beefing up the security, they have also been actively involved in smooth conduction of Illumination, Durga Puja celebrations and other events happening in the campus. This, for sure, indicates that the security measures have been strengthen over recent months and we hope that it\u2019s going to get better in future.", "created_time": "2018-11-10T06:43:25+0000", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505/2094495563904121/?type=3"}, {"pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/45748901_2094495570570787_1338070320602415104_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=085babb17ba8b80f6782c6bc3ce7a194&oe=5C835039", "id": "146188872068143_2094512563902421", "message": "Beefed up security on the Campus\nIn a conversation with Mr. S.

S. Jha, Head of the security section, we have got to know about the various measures taken by the security section of IIT Kharagpur to ensure better safety of the students and overall peacefulness on the campus. Some of these measures are:\n1) Installation of over a hundred CCTV cameras across the campus including Halls, exit and entry gates, crossover positions like Tikka and many more. This ensures tracking of the happenings on the campus in a better way and enables the security team to spot the situations where emergency measures are needed to be taken. This would help in cases like cycle thefts, inappropriate incidents etc. A proposal of installing extra three times more the CCTV cameras installed right now is underway and is soon to be procured within next one month. Earlier, Awaaz had communicated the need of CCTV cameras in the campus to the authorities based on our survey on Basic Amenities. And we are happy to see this getting implemented. \n2) Formation of Quick Response Teams (QRTs). There are 4 sets of QRT teams strolling around campus all the time and students, in case of any emergency, can call them 24 x 7 and they would be there to help you out within two to three minutes.

academics and research in India, IIT Kharagpur has signed a MoU with the premier medical institution of the country- AIIMS, New Delhi to carry out joint academic programmes (such as Ph.D, MD-Ph.D,

Mr. Niladri Sarkar had claimed himself to pursue MS at Mechanical Engineering Department of IIT KGP and having worked as External Research Associate in the Fluid Dynamics Lab of MIT. He also claimed to be pursuing research at IIT Madras and IIT Bombay at different point of times. A few months ago, when he was in KGP campus, he started approaching faculty members stating that he is an alumnus of IIT KGP and he is willing to collaborate with them for his MIT Project. However, when he was confronted by one of our alumni, Dr. Kaushik Mukherjee on sensing a foul play, he took down most of these claims from social media. Upon contacting the concerned MIT professor, it was also found out that his MIT claim was totally fake. He social engineered his way into IIT KGP. He started adding IITians (and KGPians) to his friend list. Upon seeing a lot of mutual friends, the other students added him. He then approached the junior batches posing himself as an alumnus who was visiting the college on the pretext of meeting some professors and doing research. Many students on the campus got swayed by his claims and his online activities. The students somehow thought of Mr. Niladri Sarkar as a great academician, probably all due to his Quora popularity! And this is why the students were generous enough to lend him money as and whenever he requested. He asked many students for money stating his poor financial conditions and most of them did lend him money which hasn\u2019t been returned yet. The amount that has been taken by him from the students sums up to be a hefty amount. \nThe following were the claims of Mr. Niladri Sarkar:\n1) Mr. Sarkar claims himself to be an IIT KGP student in both his Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/niladri.sarkar.3701) and Quora (https://www.quora.com/profile/Niladri-Sarkar-5) profiles which is false.\n2) He pursued MS under the supervision of Prof. P. K. Das, Department of Mechanical Engineering. We confirmed it from the professor and he denied knowing any such student under his guidance.\n3) He has an Institute ID card which does not look like the regular ones that we have.\n4) He claims to have three research papers none of which are available online since they are done in collaboration with DRDO and AIIMS. These research papers are available within IIT Council, that\u2019s what he has told some people.\n5) A mail from Prof. Indranil Manna, Director, IIT Kanpur praising his research works.\n6) The Research Quality Index certificate stating that he scored 100/100 in research and obtained an AIR 1. This certificate is claimed to be issued jointly by IIT Kanpur. According to him, this certificate is issued once in five years. However, we weren\u2019t able to find out any such Index or program being organised by any IIT or IISc.\n7) Interaction with Prof. S. K.

We confirmed it from the professor and he denied knowing any such student under his guidance.\n3) He has an Institute ID card which does not look like the regular ones that we have.\n4) He claims to have three research papers none of which are available online since they are done in collaboration with DRDO and AIIMS. These research papers are available within IIT Council, that\u2019s what he has told some people.\n5) A mail from Prof. Indranil Manna, Director, IIT Kanpur praising his research works.\n6) The Research Quality Index certificate stating that he scored 100/100 in research and obtained an AIR 1. This certificate is claimed to be issued jointly by IIT Kanpur. According to him, this certificate is issued once in five years. However, we weren\u2019t able to find out any such Index or program being organised by any IIT or IISc.\n7) Interaction with Prof. S. K. Dash, Head, Department of Mechanical Engineering and other Professors of the department in Nalanda Class Room Complex. \n8. The offer of direct PhD studentship from Prof. Pradip Dutta, Professor and Chair, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IISc.\n9) A mail from Dean MIT expressing their willingness to participate in the Indian Research Quality Index Conference which is going to be organised by him at IIT Kharagpur. No such conference took place in reality.\n10) Selection as External Research Associate in Fluid Dynamics Lab of MIT under the supervision of Prof. John Bush. Upon contacting Prof. Bush regarding the validity of the report, the document was found to be fraudulent. Prof. Bush denied having any such student under his supervision\n11) A nice conversation with Prof. Souvik Bhattacharyya, Senior Professor and Vice-Chancellor, BITS Pilani.\n 12) Telephonic interaction with Prof. Amitabha Ghosh, former Director of IIT KGP\n13) The evaluation report of MIT Fluid Dynamics Lab. \n14) There is also one online article (https://www.kenfolios.com/dont-topper-successful-proved-style/) wherein he was claimed to be KGPian.\nMost of these claims have been found false. Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur requests all the students to beware of such people including him and do not get swayed by any kind of unauthentic claims. We, as a unit, need to be safe from such elements and take care so that such incidents do not occur. Stay alert, stay cautious! Here\u2019re the relevant pictures including the claims that he has now been taken down.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1850022525018094/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33116201_1850022531684760_2767644970985717760_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=3b005ec6df3baa6f528c129080117908&oe=5B88E492", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 16 new photos.", "created_time": "2018-05-20T12:51:02+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1850026548351025"}, {"pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33026530_1848998695120477_3290767868764880896_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=8666dd9f1f2db244dcd52c1e7fd43c3b&oe=5B82833B", "id": "146188872068143_1848998688453811", "message": "Homecoming 2018, a reunion for the batch of 1998, 2003 and 2008, is going to be organized at IIT Kharagpur from 17th to 19th August 2018 by Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur.

In what can be called as a bold move from the institute administration in curbing such political influence on the mindset of the student populace of IIT Kharagpur, the Dean of Students' Affairs has circulated a mail discouraging any such events which are organized with hidden political motives. He reiterated that tagging the name of IIT Kharagpur in such events which may escalate tension in society in the name of political affiliation, religion, caste and region can not be tolerated. Although he did not mention the extent to which the institute would be considering the severity of political motive, but the statement does send out a message regarding the degree of seriousness with which such detracting events are being taken into consideration by administration. Here is what the mail reads:\n\"It is being observed that some groups with political motivation are organizing some events in IIT Kharagpur but tagging the name of IIT Kharagpur.

No need, now, to be afoot and toil in the scorching sun or get drained in the rainwater to reach your destination inside the campus. Ola Pedal is here and this has been made possible due to the great efforts of the Technology Students' Gymkhana. Now you can pick up a cycle from any of the Ola Parking Zones, majorly in the Halls of Residence, Main Building, Vikramshila and Nalanda. Using the cycles would cost you INR 5/- for the period of 15 minutes exclusive of taxes and would amount to about INR 6/- for the period including them. Just download the regular Ola Mobile App and you can book the ride, cashless and hassle-free. Enter the number below the QR code at the rear mudguard or the lock module of the cycle with the App and your cycle unlocks, ready to give your hair, the sway in the cool breeze of Kharagpur. The Ola Parking Zones are the only spots where the ride can begin or end. You can lock or unlock the cycle at any place other than these zones but the ride will continue to be chargeable in that case. The cycles cannot be taken outside the campus. \n\nThe cycles have adjustable seats, tubeless tyres, anti-slip chains and anti-rust alloy rims that make them effective to use.\n\nThe inauguration ceremony for the service will be held on 5th May 2018 from 10.30 AM. Also, it must be noted that only a few out of the forty locations will be active until July. The department locations will be active from July. More locations where the cycles would be stationed might be targetted in the future and it is when our campus would truly become easily accessible to everybody. \n\nDetailed features and functioning of the facility and the list of the Ola Parking Zones will follow soon.\nWith this hope and full appreciation to the efforts and success of Mr. Seemant Jay and the Technology Students' Gymkhana, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes everyone happy, safe and easy rides from anywhere to anywhere on this beautiful campus.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1831701613516852/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/31753578_1831701620183518_3976260643664691200_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=c71d876433bee56c22b3e10f6e51085e&oe=5B602502", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 3 new photos.", "created_time": "2018-05-02T12:38:28+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1831637850189895"}, {"message": "The beautiful campus of IIT Kharagpur is waiting for you with a slight twist in its flavour.

No need, now, to be afoot and toil in the scorching sun or get drained in the rainwater to reach your destination inside the campus. Ola Pedal is here and this has been made possible due to the great efforts of the Technology Students' Gymkhana. Now you can pick up a cycle from any of the Ola Parking Zones, majorly in the Halls of Residence, Main Building, Vikramshila and Nalanda. Using the cycles would cost you INR 5/- for the period of 15 minutes exclusive of taxes and would amount to about INR 6/- for the period including them. Just download the regular Ola Mobile App and you can book the ride, cashless and hassle-free. Enter the number below the QR code at the rear mudguard or the lock module of the cycle with the App and your cycle unlocks, ready to give your hair, the sway in the cool breeze of Kharagpur. The Ola Parking Zones are the only spots where the ride can begin or end. You can lock or unlock the cycle at any place other than these zones but the ride will continue to be chargeable in that case.

We all would love to, Right?\nAbsolutely breathtaking and exhilarating experience! Yes, that\u2019s what our reporters got when they experienced the high definition Virtual Reality simulation of Kharagpur campus and 'StarMan' driving the Roadster in space, developed by Virtual Reality Laboratory at the Industrial and Systems Engineering, IIT Kharagpur!\nThey were able to gaze through the enormous space including Earth, Moon, Mars, Sun and asteroids - all through the eyes of the Starman peeking through his window. Seeing planets rotating, passing by and the car just managing to avoid asteroids on its way - witnessing all these sitting in a chair in a small room but feeling as if you were actually an astronaut floating in the space! Getting the same thrilling experience while navigating the entire campus in virtual reality was a visual treat. They were even able to visit Tikka, drink coffee and throw the cup into the dustbin - all through motion sensors and trackers. \nEstablished and conceived in 2016 with the coordination of Partha P Chakrabarti (Director IIT Kharagpur), current Head of the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering Jhareswar Maiti and professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering Pabitra Mitra, this Virtual Reality laboratory got functional from May, 2016. It boasts of state-of-art world-class hardware and software facilities for 3D modelling, projection, navigation and tracking. \nWhile Prateek Srivastava has worked hard on the 'StarMan' project, other enthusiastic students are helping him out in the \"Virtual KGP' project which is going to be completed very soon. And the credit goes to their mentors Anirban Santara and Manorama Jha as well. \nWe often find out that most of us don't know about various research facilities available in the campus.

The team of Abhimanyu Bharade, Baibhab Pattnaik and Harsh Agarwal won the 'India Quiz' in the recently concluded Nihilanth - the Annual Inter IIT-IIM Quiz championship. After registering a thunderous sweeping win in Inter IIT Cultural Meet, their juggernaut went on to register one more victory against a formidable team of IIM Ahmedabad. Last year, they had finished last in the finals of India Quiz but they made amends for the same in the 15th edition of Nihilanth, hosted by IIM Ahmedabad from January 25-28, 2018.

Do you know when was the last time KGP Women\u2019s Basketball team had reached into the finals of Inter IIT Sports Meet? No, you might not be knowing! Let us tell you. It was 2004 and it\u2019s after a gap of 13 years that these girls have repeated the same in style by winning the silver medal with an undefeated run till finals! But this journey has neither been a cakewalk nor they were served it easily on a platter. They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most. \nIn a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn\u2019t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn\u2019t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn\u2019t play. Count goes to 7. One player was in beginning stages and lacked in the experience that it takes to play at bigger stages. Effective count goes to 6. How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? \u201cA basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.\u201d And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters.\n\nIn the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn\u2019t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay\u2019s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments \u2013 the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong. All the practice, hard work and perseverance bore sweet fruits. \nIt wasn\u2019t their victory alone. It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, \u201cWithout his strategies, the victory wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn\u2019t disappoint him. The captain Remee marshalled her troop well and her leadership was the key to this entire campaign. A huge shout to these amazing girls! \nWhat lies in the future? Most of the current players are graduating out. The team needs enthusiastic and dedicated junior players to fill the boots. As one of the players admitted, even during the practice sessions, participation from juniors was very less. They had a hard time choosing 9 players for the tournament. Participation from girls was utterly disappointing. And if that\u2019s what will keep on going, we don\u2019t stand a chance in rewriting histories in the upcoming Sports Meets. The current players have appealed to the girls to participate in as large numbers as possible. The sports scenario in KGP among girls isn\u2019t in very good shape right now. We needed inspirations to look up to. Now that we have some of them, why to wait? Hit the ground on the very first day of the next semester!", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1690953644258317/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25626256_1690953644258317_4059116407686528605_o.jpg?oh=829eb77d3ac432d300354fc43e0ac5e1&oe=5AF576D3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur is with Priyanka Bhaskar and 6 others.", "created_time": "2017-12-25T15:03:47+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1690953644258317"}, {"pic": null, "id": "146188872068143_1419094444777573", "message": "GC 2016-17 || Sports and Games || Inter Hall Badminton\n\nThird place match: Patel vs MMM2\nResult: Patel won by 2-0 as they won both in the singles and the doubles.\nWith these final Hall standings are:\n1.
