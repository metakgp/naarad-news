They told me that to take one time(single)   policy from Exide Life insurance which would be as like as bank FD and I would get Rs. 24000/- PM as interest. They told me that it could be encash anytime whenever I wish as like as bank FD.\n\nThey added that to inform them when I would received my one time policy bond at my residence and that should be kept in their custody/Exide branch without cutting that one time policy/FD bond's envelope  to process my interest@24000/-pm. \n\nAnd as per their advice I had handed over my 4 nos of above one time policy/FD bond (Sealed envelope)  to Baburam Mahapatra when I had received it without cutting all envelope.\n\nWhen I had not received any interest which they had committed to me Rs.24000/-pm since this long time (6 months time) then I discussed with my family and friends regarding their forgery. My family and friends told me that I had been cheated by Baburam Mahapatra and also I come to know that several senior citizens people have been cheated by them.\n\nI requested them several times to return back my all one time policy/FD bond to me but all time they said that my interest@24000/-pm was in process at HO and all my bond were required for it. They also told me that it would take time (4-5 months) initially and I would get accumulated interest (4-5 months) in my bank account and all one time bond all together. \n\nWhen I shouted them that time Baburam Mahapatra have given me 4 nos of above my policy/FD bond by the first week of previous  month  and I become faint by seeing of this said bond.\n\nI found that all of above said one time Exide life policy bond(which they said)  are recurring policies like LIC which I have to pay for that said term else all policies will be lapsed on 2nd year onwards.\nI have not a single paise to pay premium on 2nd year, I had invested all my savings at Exide life Insurance  as per Baburam Mahapatra's commitment that I would get interest@24000/- pm.\n\nPolicy details are mentioned below:\n\n1.Policy No:  03747862 Rs.: 750000/- for 10 years premium payment term. \n\n2. Policy No: 03747894 Rs: 750000/- for 10 years premium payment term.\n\n3. Policy No: 03780492 Rs: 48000/- for 5 years premium payment term and maturity at 15 years.\n\n4. Policy No: 03780493 Rs. 500000/-for 5 years premium payment term and maturity at 20 years.\n\nBaburam Mahapatra had taken my above amount Rs.:2048000/- which I have earned from my retirement benefit and that i had kept in my bank as FD. He told me that Exide Life has started banking business and people could invest here as bank Fixed deposit (one time) and interest (10-12%) would be credited in my bank account in monthly basis.\n\nI come to know that Baburam Mahapatra  is a big culprit and big cheater who are cheating every senior citizens people by sitting at  Exide life Golpark branch, Kolkata  office day to day. And Exide life insurance  are supporting his all fraudulent activities. He can do all this fraudulent activities by getting support from his bosses. They have a good understanding with each other regarding agents/employee's payout which they are taking day to day. This is very very unfortunate that Exide life insurance such a IRDA listed company are recruiting such fraud, cheater people like Baburam Mahapatra and have given such a senior label position like Branch Manager. Every common people like me should trust a Branch Manager of a listed co.\n\nAfter taking 30 days of time customers care people  mailed that they would  not cancel my above policies.  Mr Joydeep Banerjee called me,  i told him that your fraud employee Baburam Mahapatra cheated me by getting support from Exide co. He had taken all bonds (in sealed envelope position) when that i received. And he returned all bonds first week of previous  month. I couldn't check their terms and conditions which they are telling now, Baburam Mahapatra intentionally done it, he knew that i must cancel all bonds if i able to see their terms & conditions that time when i received that. \n\nBABURAM MAHAPATRA DIDN'T GIVE ME SCOPE FOR CANCELLATION AT FREE LOOK PERIOD. \n\nI am a retired person (63 years old) & got above all money as retirement benefit and had kept in bank (FD) & was getting interest from bank per month for which I was maintaining my family.\n\nNow I am totally helpless and not have a single paise to buy medicines for me and my wife. We are heart patient and have high blood sugar and high blood pressure.\n\nWithout any medical test Exide Life Insurance issued my all policies. They did false medical where as me and my spouse is heart patient. All information in bond are false. This all things happened by Baburam Mahapatra without taking my consent. \n\nI write to request to arrange for cancellation  above all policies and kindly refund my money Rs: 2048000/- and obliged. \n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDilip Kumar Dutta", "created_time": "2018-11-07T07:10:06+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "741132932600291_1980632758650296", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/iitkgp.tech/photos/a.1532229083490668/1980632701983635/?type=3", "message": "OPEN IIT QUIZ \n\nDate-10th November, 2018\nVenue-Raman Auditorium\nTime-2.30pm onwards\n\nThe maximum number of members in a team is 4.\nRegister at :  https://tinyurl.com/openiitquiz1819", "created_time": "2018-11-06T09:36:43+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/45683124_1980632708650301_6310624756869627904_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=b6dc48fd202d9a3764dbe2b35f273729&oe=5C83C427"}, {"id": "741132932600291_1980632758650296", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/iitkgp.tech/photos/a.1532229083490668/1980632701983635/?type=3", "message": "OPEN IIT QUIZ \n\nDate-10th November, 2018\nVenue-Raman Auditorium\nTime-2.30pm onwards\n\nThe maximum number of members in a team is 4.\nRegister at :  https://tinyurl.com/openiitquiz1819", "created_time": "2018-11-06T09:36:43+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/45683124_1980632708650301_6310624756869627904_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=b6dc48fd202d9a3764dbe2b35f273729&oe=5C83C427"}, {"id": "741132932600291_1980632758650296", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/iitkgp.tech/photos/a.1532229083490668/1980632701983635/?type=3", "message": "OPEN IIT QUIZ \n\nDate-10th November, 2018\nVenue-Raman Auditorium\nTime-2.30pm onwards\n\nThe maximum number of members in a team is 4.\nRegister at :  https://tinyurl.com/openiitquiz1819", "created_time": "2018-11-06T09:36:43+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/45683124_1980632708650301_6310624756869627904_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=b6dc48fd202d9a3764dbe2b35f273729&oe=5C83C427"}, {"id": "741132932600291_1980632758650296", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/iitkgp.tech/photos/a.1532229083490668/1980632701983635/?type=3", "message": "OPEN IIT QUIZ \n\nDate-10th November, 2018\nVenue-Raman Auditorium\nTime-2.30pm onwards\n\nThe maximum number of members in a team is 4.\nRegister at :  https://tinyurl.com/openiitquiz1819", "created_time": "2018-11-06T09:36:43+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/45683124_1980632708650301_6310624756869627904_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=b6dc48fd202d9a3764dbe2b35f273729&oe=5C83C427"}, {"id": "741132932600291_1980632758650296", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/iitkgp.tech/photos/a.1532229083490668/1980632701983635/?type=3", "message": "OPEN IIT QUIZ \n\nDate-10th November, 2018\nVenue-Raman Auditorium\nTime-2.30pm onwards\n\nThe maximum number of members in a team is 4.\nRegister at :  https://tinyurl.com/openiitquiz1819", "created_time": "2018-11-06T09:36:43+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/45683124_1980632708650301_6310624756869627904_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=b6dc48fd202d9a3764dbe2b35f273729&oe=5C83C427"}, {"id": "741132932600291_1977510315629207", "link": null, "message": "Open IIT Case Study 2018 Results:\n1.
