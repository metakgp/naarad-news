These sensors generate unprecedented amounts of data, much more than any other IoT adoption would and thus handling, processing, and analyzing this amount of data requires the prowess of 5G. \n\nMarket watchers say that 5G, when adopted at the full scale, will offer internet speeds up to 100 times faster than 4G. It will present exciting possibilities for the automobile industry used for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity. Furthermore, the technology\u2019s low latency will make these vehicles extraordinarily safe and reliable on the roads\u2014safer than vehicles today that are operated by people.\n\nAGV Research Group, IIT Kharagpur anticipates the efforts and developments in this domain and looks forward to contribute even more as a student research group!", "created_time": "2019-03-19T04:55:44+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/54516367_2206130279409596_8469676564273954816_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=eebe07ef77d4acda9bdd99da2284e605&oe=5D142F54"}, {"id": "414439858578656_2135641509791807", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/agvkgp/photos/a.825620170793954/2135641489791809/?type=3", "message": "Hey folks, Thanks for being a great audience at our introductory seminar! \n\nNow it is time to test your grey matter and problem-solving skills as the first step of our selection process.

That access to fast, low-cost delivery could make it irresistible to order even more stuff \u2014 and send profound ripples through the economy.\n\nDetails: \nKPMG predicts goods will be delivered via AV fleets operating in \"islands of autonomy\" where, because of population density and regulations, deployment makes sense.\n\nThey envision orders for goods being filled using a combination of artificial intelligence and robots, then delivered via a fleet of autonomous vehicles.\nIn some places, packages or groceries could be delivered right to your door. In more congested urban areas, it might be sent to a secure locker, the modern-day equivalent of a milk box.

But when will we get there, and how will we get there?\n \nTwo terms for the transition have become standard in the auto industry. There's the \"evolutionary\" path to autonomous vehicles, where today's cars get self-driving features bit by bit \u2014 Tesla's autopilot feature, for example. And then there's the \"revolutionary\" path. That's where totally self-driving cars, like the ones Google is working on, start as test vehicles and become more mainstream as they can drive in more places.\nThere's an ongoing debate over which path is the safer one. But these paths will eventually converge.\n \nToday's most advanced semi-autonomous features can be found in Tesla's and a few other cars that allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel on a highway. Using a series of sensors and cameras, cars can also merge, self-park, stay within a lane and brake as needed.\n \nThis tech works particularly well for commercial trucks that operate on highways. Companies like Peloton and NXP are \"platooning\" trucks \u2014 tying them together through a vehicle-to-vehicle communication system. A \"pilot\" truck drives while those behind can sit and relax.\n\nGoogle and Ford are testing self-driving cars in structured environments like test tracks, as well as cities with relatively light traffic, like Austin, Texas and Mountain View, Calif. Vehicles travel at slow speeds \u2014 up to 25 miles an hour \u2014 while gathering data on pedestrians and human drivers; they are also starting to drive at night, and in rain and snow.\n \nBy 2019, Driver-assistance features will get more sophisticated, and will sync up with GPS and navigation. So a driver should be able to input a destination while driving on a highway, turn on adaptive cruise control and let the car drive itself. When it gets to the appropriate exit, the car will return control to the driver.\n\nIn the USA, NHTSA (NATIONAL HIGHWAYS TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION) has begun working on rules for testing and deployment of fully autonomous vehicles, without a driver, across the country. In the meantime, companies like Google will be racking up miles to gather data about every single type of situation a self-driving vehicle might encounter; mapping companies will gather as much 3D data in major cities as possible. Car makers and tech companies will have to make sure light detection and ranging (lidar) and radar sensors, as well as cameras and GPS, can work together, while ensuring that each component can function independently if one of them fails\n.\nCompanies will also be testing vehicles in all climates and environments, including rain and snow. They'll also test cars in more places, moving from test tracks and low-density cities to roads with more foot and vehicle traffic. \n \nCommercial trucks will likely be the first vehicles to hit the road autonomously, if state and federal regulators give them them the go-ahead to work on highways. \n \nHere is one such article on the legislation making rounds in the Congress for federal rules on self driving cars to supersede state and local regulations :\n \nhttps://www.wired.com/story/congress-autonomous-self-driving-car-regulations/", "created_time": "2017-07-04T05:14:51+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_1471616146194350", "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/congress-autonomous-self-driving-car-regulations/", "message": "Self-driving cars are coming \u2014 sooner than you think.

In the meantime, companies like Google will be racking up miles to gather data about every single type of situation a self-driving vehicle might encounter; mapping companies will gather as much 3D data in major cities as possible. Car makers and tech companies will have to make sure light detection and ranging (lidar) and radar sensors, as well as cameras and GPS, can work together, while ensuring that each component can function independently if one of them fails\n.\nCompanies will also be testing vehicles in all climates and environments, including rain and snow. They'll also test cars in more places, moving from test tracks and low-density cities to roads with more foot and vehicle traffic. \n \nCommercial trucks will likely be the first vehicles to hit the road autonomously, if state and federal regulators give them them the go-ahead to work on highways. \n \nHere is one such article on the legislation making rounds in the Congress for federal rules on self driving cars to supersede state and local regulations :\n \nhttps://www.wired.com/story/congress-autonomous-self-driving-car-regulations/", "created_time": "2017-07-04T05:14:51+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_10208374019454912", "link": "http://qz.com/924917", "message": "One more Coverage of  our work from Quartz, India !!", "created_time": "2017-03-10T17:40:36+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_10208374019454912", "link": "http://qz.com/924917", "message": "One more Coverage of  our work from Quartz, India !!", "created_time": "2017-03-10T17:40:36+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_1350042878351678", "link": "http://www.thebetterindia.com/90134/tesla-google-iit-india-first-driverless-car/", "message": "The Economic Times and The Better India covered our work recently.\n\nhttp://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/engineering/three-iits-join-hands-to-build-self-driving-cars/articleshow/57419669.cms", "created_time": "2017-03-04T12:35:40+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_1350042878351678", "link": "http://www.thebetterindia.com/90134/tesla-google-iit-india-first-driverless-car/", "message": "The Economic Times and The Better India covered our work recently.\n\nhttp://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/engineering/three-iits-join-hands-to-build-self-driving-cars/articleshow/57419669.cms", "created_time": "2017-03-04T12:35:40+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_1347508098605156", "link": "http://www.scholarsavenue.org/campus-2/know-your-research-groups-autonomous-ground-vehicle/", "message": "Do read The Scholars' Avenue's coverage of our work.", "created_time": "2017-03-01T12:15:36+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_1347508098605156", "link": "http://www.scholarsavenue.org/campus-2/know-your-research-groups-autonomous-ground-vehicle/", "message": "Do read The Scholars' Avenue's coverage of our work.", "created_time": "2017-03-01T12:15:36+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_1325195310836435", "link": null, "message": "", "created_time": "2017-02-04T08:53:55+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_1325195310836435", "link": null, "message": "", "created_time": "2017-02-04T08:53:55+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "414439858578656_1325172290838737", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/agvkgp/photos/a.417454964943812.92154.414439858578656/1325172290838737/?type=3", "message": "Freshers' Selections\n\nWe thank you for your enthusiastic participation in our Introductory seminar.
