I am sure our students and myself will take back a lot of inspiration and an attitude to excel.\"\n\nWe sincerely hope that the teams from GIIS, Singapore will have a memorable experience at IIT Kharagpur.", "created_time": "2018-10-24T15:54:38+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "123930134625611_772030299815588", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/barciitkgp/videos/274731493249163/", "message": "Young Innovators' Programme, IIT Kharagpur, 2018\nSchool name: Vista Pearson School\nTeam name: Dawnsite Vista\n\nOnline Audience Marks:\n1 View = 5 Points\n1 Reaction = 10 Points\n1 Share = 20 Points", "created_time": "2018-10-23T15:37:15+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "123930134625611_772030299815588", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/barciitkgp/videos/274731493249163/", "message": "Young Innovators' Programme, IIT Kharagpur, 2018\nSchool name: Vista Pearson School\nTeam name: Dawnsite Vista\n\nOnline Audience Marks:\n1 View = 5 Points\n1 Reaction = 10 Points\n1 Share = 20 Points", "created_time": "2018-10-23T15:37:15+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "123930134625611_772030299815588", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/barciitkgp/videos/274731493249163/", "message": "Young Innovators' Programme, IIT Kharagpur, 2018\nSchool name: Vista Pearson School\nTeam name: Dawnsite Vista\n\nOnline Audience Marks:\n1 View = 5 Points\n1 Reaction = 10 Points\n1 Share = 20 Points", "created_time": "2018-10-23T15:37:15+0000", "pic": null}, {"id": "123930134625611_771485653203386", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/barciitkgp/photos/a.138711956480762/771478816537403/?type=3", "message": "In the recently released QS World University Rankings 2019,  IIT-Kharagpur showed an improvement from last year as it bettered its ranking to 295, to land within the top 300 universities of the world.

The students will get the opportunity to interact with the Director, administrative team, faculty members and senior students of IIT Kharagpur to learn about the Institute and community life,their halls of residence and respective departments and opportunities thereof. Motivational sessions by alumni achievers have also been organized related to career, success, culture,frontiers of science and technology, self, etc. \u201cThis Induction Program has proved to be extremely helpful to us. We would otherwise have gone to various sections of the Institute and spent much longer period of time to collect this information which is critical for us\u201d said Balashree, a first year student.\nPhoto Credit: Click Kgp", "created_time": "2018-07-27T15:31:00+0000", "story": "Branding And Relations Cell, IIT Kharagpur added 5 new photos."}, {"id": "123930134625611_704985099853442", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/barciitkgp/photos/a.138711956480762.1073741828.123930134625611/704983603186925/?type=3", "message": "We at Branding And Relations Cell, IIT Kharagpur are extremely grateful to everybody who believed and supported us, without whom we wouldn't have been able to work with single minded devotion.

New research has come up with an alternative that can power the pacemaker continuously \u2014 a nanogenerator that harvests electricity out of spider silk. Scientists at IIT Kharagpur , along with a team of researchers from South Korea, have devised a self-powered, piezoelectric nanogenerator that can harvest green energy from various mechanical and biomechanical motions.\n\nPiezoelectricity is the generation of electric charges in certain solid materials in response to applied mechanical stress \u2014 such as the body\u2019s motion, wind and water flow, or sound vibration. A piezoelectric nanogenerator can harvest external kinetic or mechanical/bio-mechanical energy into electrical energy via action by means of a nano-structured piezoelectric material.\n\nThe research, published in Nano Energy, describes how piezoelectricity can be generated by applying pressure on fibre \u2014 in this case spider-silk fibre. IIT Kharagpur scientists say this technology can be used in healthcare monitoring, such as in pacemakers and other medical equipment.\n\n\u201cThere are many materials in nature which have piezoelectric properties. When pressure is applied, it leads to changes in the molecular structure of the material, making it capable of harvesting mechanical/bio-mechanical energy into green electricity. When capacitors are attached to the external circuit, the electrical energy can be stored and this becomes an alternative energy source to thermal energy or hydroelectric energy or solar energy,\u201d said Professor B B Khatua of IIT Kharagpur's Material Science Center, who led the research. \u201cThere are various ceramic or metal-oxide-based piezoelectric materials. But due to their brittleness and toxic nature, these materials have limitations for application inside the human body.

Assembling a spider-silk-based nano generator as a self-chargeable power source, the energy required to make the pacemaker work can be created by the heartbeat.

The power generated from a single unit lights up 25 green LEDs instantly. Prof Khatua said it can be used not only in pacemakers but in many other devices, and also for harvesting green energy and even for large-scale industrial applications.\n\n\u201cThe self-powered, spider-silk-based flexible nanogenerator is extremely sensitive to even minute pressure generated from body motions, even the very small pressure arising from arterial pulse (signals arising out of small strains), throat movement during coughing, speaking, and drinking.

With the results just out, many know their scores, but not where they are headed or which discipline they would like to opt for. The social media is, naturally, abuzz with all sorts of queries. For those with a reasonably good score, the question is, \u201cShould I join Electronics or Computer Science to ensure better placement?\u201d Some have been asking, \u201cWith a score like mine, I may be eligible for Agriculture & Food Engineering. But what are the placement prospects?\u201d\n\nExperts at the Career Development Centre, IIT Kharagpur say that in the end, it is the CGPA that matters, and not the discipline one studies.

This allows students to make career choices irrespective of their qualifying degree. \n\nInterdisciplinary courses at IIT Kharagpur given the unique diversity of its academic units and research capability, cover a wide range of areas highly relevant to industry.

In this program, while the B.Tech is undertaken in one major discipline, M.Tech can be undertaken in another discipline ranging from analytics, computation, finance, programming, engineering entrepreneurship or quality engineering design and manufacturing. All these skills are highly valued in top multinational corporations and PSUs. \n\nInternational exposure is considered crucial by the Institute. Apart from inviting foreign faculty to take classes in the Institute through the government-funded #GIAN (Global Initiative of Academic Networks ) program, IIT Kharagpur also runs several programs of its own that facilitate the process. #The_Foreign_Training_Program (FTP) enables and financially supports students to find foreign research internships. \n\n#The_Semester_Away_Program (SAP) also provides students of IIT Kharagpur the unique opportunity of studying in any university of their choice whether in India or abroad for a semester.

In many cases, good legal advice can lead to expedite solutions, she said. \"Sometimes it is even necessary to avoid long legal wrangles and take immediate action,\" she said. In marital cases, too, timely legal advice may lead to early resolution, she said. \"When we enable the mechanism of legal aid to the village sarpanch or panchayat leader - peoples' first level of contact with authority - the people are already enabled. This is the reason why the legal aid cells plan of spreading legal literacy is so important,\" she said. The cell will also provide assistance on cyber issues, assist in the protection of indigenous crafts and other areas where its expertise in intellectual property rights needed, she said. A significant activity of the cell would be to provide intellectual property rights (IPR) protection service, especially where its expertise is required in building a case for GI and registering it, she added. Geographical indication (GI) is a unique case which is directly related not just to one artisan but to the communities that use local resources for sustenance of livelihoods, the professor said. Apart from this, the law school has plans to create a group of paralegal volunteers who will work with the district legal services. Professor Padmavati hoped that the cell would eventually go online to provide legal assistance to a larger number of people. Justice Aniruddha Bose, Judge, Calcutta High Court and Executive Chairman, West Bengal Legal Services, inaugurated the cell earlier this month. The Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law (RGSOIPL) in IIT-Kharagpur is a unique law school that was set up in 2006 with the help of a distinguished alumnus Vinod Gupta to groom the scientists and engineers into intellectual property lawyers. The law school offers a three-year LLB program with specialisation in intellectual property law (IPL) recognised by the Bar Council of India, the LLM program in various disciplines of law and a doctoral program.", "created_time": "2018-02-15T14:38:16+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27858600_603708933314393_1822946556202372414_n.jpg?oh=995906927c2093d9daaba84534c3e00d&oe=5B05A5B9"}, {"id": "123930134625611_600355766983043", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-aiims-hospital-to-start-ops-by-year-end/articleshow/62828977.cms", "message": "Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur will join hands with All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to set up the coveted Dr B C Roy Institute of Medical Science & Research \u2014 the first medical hospital in an IIT, with an aim to offer medical courses in future.The hospital will start operations by 2018 end.
