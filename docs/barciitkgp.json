New research has come up with an alternative that can power the pacemaker continuously \u2014 a nanogenerator that harvests electricity out of spider silk. Scientists at IIT Kharagpur , along with a team of researchers from South Korea, have devised a self-powered, piezoelectric nanogenerator that can harvest green energy from various mechanical and biomechanical motions.\n\nPiezoelectricity is the generation of electric charges in certain solid materials in response to applied mechanical stress \u2014 such as the body\u2019s motion, wind and water flow, or sound vibration. A piezoelectric nanogenerator can harvest external kinetic or mechanical/bio-mechanical energy into electrical energy via action by means of a nano-structured piezoelectric material.\n\nThe research, published in Nano Energy, describes how piezoelectricity can be generated by applying pressure on fibre \u2014 in this case spider-silk fibre. IIT Kharagpur scientists say this technology can be used in healthcare monitoring, such as in pacemakers and other medical equipment.\n\n\u201cThere are many materials in nature which have piezoelectric properties. When pressure is applied, it leads to changes in the molecular structure of the material, making it capable of harvesting mechanical/bio-mechanical energy into green electricity. When capacitors are attached to the external circuit, the electrical energy can be stored and this becomes an alternative energy source to thermal energy or hydroelectric energy or solar energy,\u201d said Professor B B Khatua of IIT Kharagpur's Material Science Center, who led the research. \u201cThere are various ceramic or metal-oxide-based piezoelectric materials. But due to their brittleness and toxic nature, these materials have limitations for application inside the human body. Spider silk, however, is both biocompatible and biodegradable and is therefore perfect for being used inside the body.\u201d\n\nWhile the pacemaker will keep the heart ticking, the heartbeat will in turn keep the pacemaker going. \u201cIn battery-operated pacemakers, once the life of the battery is over, you need to replace it. Assembling a spider-silk-based nano generator as a self-chargeable power source, the energy required to make the pacemaker work can be created by the heartbeat. Every time the heart beats, it will create external pressure on the spider silk, making it generate energy,\u201d Prof Khatua said.\n\nThe nanogenerator was prepared by spraying water on spider silk and wrapping it around the device. The power generated from a single unit lights up 25 green LEDs instantly. Prof Khatua said it can be used not only in pacemakers but in many other devices, and also for harvesting green energy and even for large-scale industrial applications.\n\n\u201cThe self-powered, spider-silk-based flexible nanogenerator is extremely sensitive to even minute pressure generated from body motions, even the very small pressure arising from arterial pulse (signals arising out of small strains), throat movement during coughing, speaking, and drinking. This shows its potentiality in healthcare-monitoring applications\u2026 Its sensitiveness could also be used to monitor robotic applications,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is the first time that a natural product like spider silk has been effectively used as a piezoelectric nanogenerator without any chemical treatment. Prof Khatua said the same team had conducted similar research with onion peels, which was published last year by IIT Kharagpur. The spider-silk energy technology took one year to devise.\n\nProfessor Khatua said devices made of these materials have the added advantage of size. \u201cThey can be thin, like a band-aid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can externally be used for small electronic devices such as mobile phones, watches and calculators among others.\u201d Prof Khatua\u2019s team included IIT research student Sumanta Kumar Karan, in collaboration with Prof Jin Kon Kim and Dr Sandip Maiti (ex-PhD student of Prof Khatua) from POSTECH, South Korea. The piezoelectric nature of the spider silk was further tested and improvised by a research team of Prof Yunseok Kim from SKKU, South Korea.

They also have the ability to generate significant power to the energy deficient world without contributing to environmental pollution. \n Bio-piezoelectric have serious drawbacks, such as availability, toxicity, non-biodegradable, non-bio compatibility, industrially unfavorable as well as complex fabrication steps, which limit its potential applications in real life.\nThe membrane was coated on both sides with thin copper tapes, and gold electrodes were attached to them. The arrangement was encapsulated in silicon-based organic polymer.Researchers showed that assembling five of these devices provides enough voltage to light-up over 90 green LEDs. The findings suggest that the advance can be effectively commercialized.The device is ultra-sensitive towards very minute pressure arising from pulse, body motions at rest and walking conditions and water drop, suggesting that it could be used to power numerous applications including fitness trackers, health monitors and sensors.\nThe work would have a significant role towards up-lifting the green energy harvesting technology as self-powered implantable and wearable electronics.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/36489800_680778552274097_1488153189642403840_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=1dc424d231a26ff56277a15968fce6bb&oe=5BA0C843"}, {"created_time": "2018-06-27T16:09:20+0000", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/barciitkgp/photos/a.138711956480762.1073741828.123930134625611/676785299340089/?type=3", "id": "123930134625611_676785512673401", "message": "IIT Kharagpur as it makes its way past all other institutes to be ranked as the best government institute of the country in a report by India Today.

In many cases, good legal advice can lead to expedite solutions, she said. \"Sometimes it is even necessary to avoid long legal wrangles and take immediate action,\" she said. In marital cases, too, timely legal advice may lead to early resolution, she said. \"When we enable the mechanism of legal aid to the village sarpanch or panchayat leader - peoples' first level of contact with authority - the people are already enabled. This is the reason why the legal aid cells plan of spreading legal literacy is so important,\" she said. The cell will also provide assistance on cyber issues, assist in the protection of indigenous crafts and other areas where its expertise in intellectual property rights needed, she said. A significant activity of the cell would be to provide intellectual property rights (IPR) protection service, especially where its expertise is required in building a case for GI and registering it, she added. Geographical indication (GI) is a unique case which is directly related not just to one artisan but to the communities that use local resources for sustenance of livelihoods, the professor said. Apart from this, the law school has plans to create a group of paralegal volunteers who will work with the district legal services. Professor Padmavati hoped that the cell would eventually go online to provide legal assistance to a larger number of people. Justice Aniruddha Bose, Judge, Calcutta High Court and Executive Chairman, West Bengal Legal Services, inaugurated the cell earlier this month. The Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law (RGSOIPL) in IIT-Kharagpur is a unique law school that was set up in 2006 with the help of a distinguished alumnus Vinod Gupta to groom the scientists and engineers into intellectual property lawyers. The law school offers a three-year LLB program with specialisation in intellectual property law (IPL) recognised by the Bar Council of India, the LLM program in various disciplines of law and a doctoral program.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27858600_603708933314393_1822946556202372414_n.jpg?oh=995906927c2093d9daaba84534c3e00d&oe=5B05A5B9"}, {"created_time": "2018-02-09T14:30:00+0000", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-aiims-hospital-to-start-ops-by-year-end/articleshow/62828977.cms", "id": "123930134625611_600355766983043", "message": "Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur will join hands with All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to set up the coveted Dr B C Roy Institute of Medical Science & Research \u2014 the first medical hospital in an IIT, with an aim to offer medical courses in future.The hospital will start operations by 2018 end.
