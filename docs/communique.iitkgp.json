Here is the first article as a part of #CQ_Social_showoff by Kshitiz Khandelwal. I laughed my ass out reading this. May none of you experience what Mr.Kshitiz did\ud83d\ude02.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-_RtMWfiIuL_VT7I9r-okUm3jjs-tFms3mvO3FxGsY/edit?usp=sharing\n\n                                                                     Lavatory                                         anecdotal_humour\n\nThis happened to me on my first ever air trip to Mumbai. My dad wanted my first experience in flight to be the best, so he booked our tickets on a Jet Airways flight with a premium dinner. We were three, my mom's sister, my dad, et moi. Everything was going smoothly until a chocolate smoothie ruined my smooth flight experience. Three of them to be precise. We were served excellent dinner that day with a chocolate smoothie. Dad doesn't like chocolates, so he passed on his smoothie to the window seat. My mom's sister was afraid that the smoothie might add calories to her diet with her wedding in a fortnight in Mumbai for which we were onboard. She smoothly passed her smoothie to the window seat. I was sitting in the window seat. I quickly finished my dinner, slid my plate under the seat and looked with utmost desire at the three delicious chocolate smoothies. I savoured every single spoon of it which tasted unimaginably awesome.\nI was looking out of the window while the chocolate did its thing. Slowly and steadily, as the chocolate smoothie found its way down my intestine, I had a sudden urge to take a dump. I controlled my urge until it was uncontrollable. I quickly rushed to the washroom and did my thing and here comes the climax, where is the water jet? Where in the world could they hide the most important sanitary device in that complicated western toilet? I looked around, checked all the drawers in the washroom but all in vain. I even realised that there was no water in the commode and felt that the aeroplane might be out of water due to which they removed the water jet too. I was an amateur, young and shy back then and most importantly a first-time air traveller. Back then, I didn't really know that some civilizations used to dry-wipe their bottoms. Moreover, the tissue roll was out of stock too. I could only see a few buttons on the side panel but I was afraid that one of them might alarm the pilots for an emergency landing. I was even afraid to press the flush button, but after a ten-minute long struggle, I finally prepared myself to take the risk. The flush button was the only mode of rescue left and I finally, after a lot of reluctance, pressed it. And boom, even the flush was a dry suction cleaner which very noisily pulled my poop into itself. Very very noisily which scared the shit out of me.\nHaving failed at a lot of things inside, I hurriedly knocked on the door and thankfully, the air hostess answered. I told her to call my dad as I needed some help. Dad was asleep so my aunt came to see what was wrong. I opened the door slightly and whispered into her ear about what was wrong, to prevent the gorgeous air hostesses from judging me. I even told my aunt to do something which does not involve the air hostesses so as to not get embarrassed. But alas! she didn't listen to me. She arranged for a couple of glass of water and gave them to me. I finally did my thing and shadily came out of the washroom with all the air hostesses looking at me weirdly. I gave a weird smile and rushed towards my seat as quickly as possible to see how my aunt narrated it to my dad who laughed at the way I gulped those chocolate smoothies. They were delicious though. And embarrassing.\nKshitiz Khandelwal                                        https://www.facebook.com/kshitiz.khandelwal.90", "link": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-_RtMWfiIuL_VT7I9r-okUm3jjs-tFms3mvO3FxGsY/edit?usp=sharing", "id": "180439175309899_1989867751033690", "created_time": "2018-08-25T05:05:30+0000"}, {"pic": null, "message": "Ahoy junta!\nBudding writers, interested artists, brilliant pun'ners, good-at-one-liner-ers and the versatile poets.\nLiterature is an art.
