The rally, which started at Gymkhana and concluded at the Nehru Museum, was full of enthusiastic sloganeers who enchanted patriotic slogans like 'Vande Mataram', 'Bharat Mata ki Jai'. At Nehru Museum, proceedings started with the National Song, followed by words of Bhagat Singh which reads as, ' They may kill me, but they cannot kill my ideas. They can crush my body, but they will not be able to crush my spirit '. Further, the anchor narrated the history of Hijli detention camp and two freedom fighters who were hanged there (Hijli detention camp)- Santosh Kumar Mitra and Tarkeshwar Sengupta. Thereafter, the president of the event, Prof Virendra Kumar Tewari (Agriculture & Food Engineering Department) spoke about the comparison between the mentality of those youth freedom fighters with nowadays youth about freedom. Then he welcomed Chief Guest of the event, Commander Veerendra Kumar Jaitely, an IIT Kgp alumnus. <br>  <br> Commander Jaitely saluted the brave freedom fighters and then told about one shaheed of IIT Kharagpur, V.K.Jain (INS Khukri) from Electronics Department, 1966 Batch.

One of them didn't submit their contact details so we couldn't even reach them to let them know and hence had to take the next highest scorer present. We later got to know that there were two-three people who didn't want to see if they could qualify and didn't submit their answer sheet for checking, where it turned out that they would've actually qualified for the finals. The team that won actually had a member like that, who after giving up, decided to go to his room, from where he had to be called to come back for the finals and eventually won. The finals itself was a cliffhanger with the podium places getting decided in the last two questions of the quiz. <br>  <br> Furthermore, there were no women in attendance.

One of them didn't submit their contact details so we couldn't even reach them to let them know and hence had to take the next highest scorer present. We later got to know that there were two-three people who didn't want to see if they could qualify and didn't submit their answer sheet for checking, where it turned out that they would've actually qualified for the finals. The team that won actually had a member like that, who after giving up, decided to go to his room, from where he had to be called to come back for the finals and eventually won. The finals itself was a cliffhanger with the podium places getting decided in the last two questions of the quiz. <br>  <br> Furthermore, there were no women in attendance.

And this figure has been relentlessly increasing day by day. While most of this surge can be attributed to the increased infrastructure in this period, misuse and wastage of electricity also play a pivotal role in this colossal figure. Many time, we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness. <br> And guess what? It's our irresponsibleness that's been adding to the expenditure and consumption figure day by day. For the last couple of months, our reporters have been observing the common habits that we KGPians have when it comes to using electrical appliances. What we've found is that there has been a huge insensitiveness towards the wastage of electricity. Many lights and fans remain on even when there is absolutely no need of that. While most of this has been observed in the Academic Complex and Halls of Residences, it has been seen in various Departments, street lights on roads etc. Even if we see it happening right in front of us, we either simply don't care or it seems too demanding for us to get that fixed. This completely reflects the fact that we, as a community, have failed to deliver on the responsibilities. <br> We should never forget that there are still more than 150 million people in our country who do not know how does it feel to spend nights with lights!

And this figure has been relentlessly increasing day by day. While most of this surge can be attributed to the increased infrastructure in this period, misuse and wastage of electricity also play a pivotal role in this colossal figure. Many time, we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness. <br> And guess what? It's our irresponsibleness that's been adding to the expenditure and consumption figure day by day. For the last couple of months, our reporters have been observing the common habits that we KGPians have when it comes to using electrical appliances. What we've found is that there has been a huge insensitiveness towards the wastage of electricity. Many lights and fans remain on even when there is absolutely no need of that. While most of this has been observed in the Academic Complex and Halls of Residences, it has been seen in various Departments, street lights on roads etc. Even if we see it happening right in front of us, we either simply don't care or it seems too demanding for us to get that fixed. This completely reflects the fact that we, as a community, have failed to deliver on the responsibilities. <br> We should never forget that there are still more than 150 million people in our country people who do not know how does it feel to spend nights with lights!

The faculty and students of the school will run legal aid and IP facilitation camps on Saturdays in order to provide assistance to whoever may require it, institute officials said. 'Access to legal aid is still a problem in Indian society, especially in rural areas. <br>  <br> In many cases, a legal step is simple but people hesitate to take it,' Professor Padmavati M, Dean of the IIT-Kharagpur Law School said. In many cases, good legal advice can lead to expedite solutions, she said. 'Sometimes it is even necessary to avoid long legal wrangles and take immediate action,' she said. In marital cases, too, timely legal advice may lead to early resolution, she said. 'When we enable the mechanism of legal aid to the village sarpanch or panchayat leader - peoples' first level of contact with authority - the people are already enabled. This is the reason why the legal aid cells plan of spreading legal literacy is so important,' she said. The cell will also provide assistance on cyber issues, assist in the protection of indigenous crafts and other areas where its expertise in intellectual property rights needed, she said. A significant activity of the cell would be to provide intellectual property rights (IPR) protection service, especially where its expertise is required in building a case for GI and registering it, she added. Geographical indication (GI) is a unique case which is directly related not just to one artisan but to the communities that use local resources for sustenance of livelihoods, the professor said. Apart from this, the law school has plans to create a group of paralegal volunteers who will work with the district legal services. Professor Padmavati hoped that the cell would eventually go online to provide legal assistance to a larger number of people. Justice Aniruddha Bose, Judge, Calcutta High Court and Executive Chairman, West Bengal Legal Services, inaugurated the cell earlier this month. The Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law (RGSOIPL) in IIT-Kharagpur is a unique law school that was set up in 2006 with the help of a distinguished alumnus Vinod Gupta to groom the scientists and engineers into intellectual property lawyers. The law school offers a three-year LLB program with specialisation in intellectual property law (IPL) recognised by the Bar Council of India, the LLM program in various disciplines of law and a doctoral program.", "real_date": "15-02-2018", "real_time": "08:08PM"}, {"id": "146188872068143_1745959268757754", "read_more": 1, "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/27913048_1745958995424448_8938128378309249173_o.jpg?oh=a2d7ea7411546f0f3b659c687f1ac62f&oe=5B1F6F79", "flag": 1, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1745958995424448/?type=3", "created_time": "2018-02-15T04:30:00+0000", "short_message": "This year IIT Kharagpur is organizing the 2nd Edition of the INAE Youth Conclave here at IIT Kharagpur! <br>  <br> The Conclave provides an opportunity", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "message": "This year IIT Kharagpur is organizing the 2nd Edition of the INAE Youth Conclave here at IIT Kharagpur! <br>  <br> The Conclave provides an opportunity to the students for showcasing their abilities in 6 exciting competitions across the domains of Academic Planning, Product Design & Development, and Mobile App Development. <br>  <br> Deadline for submission of abstracts is 1st March 2018.

Established in May 2016 under the mentorship of the Prof Partha P Chakrabarti, Director IIT Kharagpur, and under the charge of Prof Jhareswar Maiti, Head of Department, Industrial and Systems Engineering, the SAVR Lab has state of the art facilities to carry out research in Virtual Reality. The lab is equipped with the essential tools such as 3D laser scanners, military-grade head-mounted displays, oculus rifts, data gloves, powerful computers, projectors etc. The lab has been sponsored by the Government of India under the Uchhatar Avishkar Yojana (UAY) to promote Virtual Reality research. <br>   <br> Their \u201chero project\u201d, for all the Elon Musk fans out there, is a Virtual Reality [VR] simulation of SpaceX\u2019s Star-man created by Prateek Srivastava [Third-year undergraduate, Department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture].  <br>   <br> A team of 10 students including Manorama Jha[research scholar] and Siddharth Jindal [Third-year undergraduate, Department of Mathematics and Computing]  led by Prateek and mentored by Mr. Anirban Santara [PhD scholar and a 2015 B.Tech graduate, Department of Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering], who is popular in the Artificial Intelligence community of Kharagpur, are working on the Virtual KGP project, a complete open-source VR simulation of the campus which they hope will help in initiating other projects for development of different VR applications. To aid the completion of the project they intend to organize various hackathons where students will be awarded for adding intricate details.

A team of post graduate students and faculty members from IIT Kharagpur seem to have finally found a solution for these clickbaits, that is, webpages with luring titles but irrelevant content. IIT-KGP's solution is a browser extension named 'Stop Clickbait' that can detect and block clickbaits with more than 90% accuracy. Following this up, they are working with Microsoft to assess the relevance of the revenue models of such advertisements. <br>  <br> The team has analysed linguistic patterns and complemented it with tracking news and twitter posts of different national and international media channels over several months to develop this extension which already has over a 2000 downloads. <br>  <br> Prof. Niloy Ganguly, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur says,  <br> 'Our primary aim is to offer a choice to the readers.

Around 50-60 students haven't updated their bank details (Account numbers and other information) and since the MCM scholarship is credited batchwise at once, incomplete bank details of some students is the reason why the amount hasn't been credited yet.  <br> These concerned students have been mailed and informed many a times to update their bank details but of no avail. Due to some of the students, many students who used to pay their semester fees with the MCM scholarship money have not been able too register yet. Other students who are in dire need of financial assistance and MCM has been their only source for the same, are also facing difficulties of various degrees. As more details were revealed, it was found out that some students have also filled invalid contact numbers and account numbers (containing alphabets) such as MV34GK.  <br> This kind of sheer negligence and carelessness on students' part is gross irresponsibility on students' part and goes on to show that how insensitive have they become towards abiding by the rules and regulations. And their negligence has affected not only them but also many of the needy students who would have liked to get the scholarship as soon as possible.  <br> We would like to appeal to the student community to fill the necessary details as soon as possible. Also, we all should make efforts henceforth so that such kind of incidents do not get repeated Inn the future.", "real_date": "18-01-2018", "real_time": "09:59PM"}, {"id": "986878814670848_2284788218213228", "read_more": null, "pic": null, "flag": 1, "link": null, "created_time": "2018-01-18T15:59:21+0000", "short_message": "Guys, we're starting the quiz meeting in 10 mins , in the Gymkhana sports library .

Do you know when was the last time KGP Women\u2019s Basketball team had reached into the finals of Inter IIT Sports Meet? No, you might not be knowing! Let us tell you. It was 2004 and it\u2019s after a gap of 13 years that these girls have repeated the same in style by winning the silver medal with an undefeated run till finals! But this journey has neither been a cakewalk nor they were served it easily on a platter. They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most.  <br> In a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn\u2019t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn\u2019t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn\u2019t play. Count goes to 7. One player was in beginning stages and lacked in the experience that it takes to play at bigger stages. Effective count goes to 6. How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? \u201cA basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.\u201d And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters. <br>  <br> In the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn\u2019t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay\u2019s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments \u2013 the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong. All the practice, hard work and perseverance bore sweet fruits.  <br> It wasn\u2019t their victory alone. It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, \u201cWithout his strategies, the victory wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn\u2019t disappoint him. The captain Remee marshalled her troop well and her leadership was the key to this entire campaign. A huge shout to these amazing girls!  <br> What lies in the future? Most of the current players are graduating out. The team needs enthusiastic and dedicated junior players to fill the boots. As one of the players admitted, even during the practice sessions, participation from juniors was very less. They had a hard time choosing 9 players for the tournament. Participation from girls was utterly disappointing. And if that\u2019s what will keep on going, we don\u2019t stand a chance in rewriting histories in the upcoming Sports Meets.

But when will we get there, and how will we get there? <br>   <br> Two terms for the transition have", "source": "Autonomous Ground Vehicle", "message": "Self-driving cars are coming \u2014 sooner than you think. But when will we get there, and how will we get there? <br>   <br> Two terms for the transition have become standard in the auto industry. There's the 'evolutionary' path to autonomous vehicles, where today's cars get self-driving features bit by bit \u2014 Tesla's autopilot feature, for example. And then there's the 'revolutionary' path. That's where totally self-driving cars, like the ones Google is working on, start as test vehicles and become more mainstream as they can drive in more places. <br> There's an ongoing debate over which path is the safer one. But these paths will eventually converge. <br>   <br> Today's most advanced semi-autonomous features can be found in Tesla's and a few other cars that allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel on a highway. Using a series of sensors and cameras, cars can also merge, self-park, stay within a lane and brake as needed. <br>   <br> This tech works particularly well for commercial trucks that operate on highways. Companies like Peloton and NXP are 'platooning' trucks \u2014 tying them together through a vehicle-to-vehicle communication system. A 'pilot' truck drives while those behind can sit and relax. <br>  <br> Google and Ford are testing self-driving cars in structured environments like test tracks, as well as cities with relatively light traffic, like Austin, Texas and Mountain View, Calif. Vehicles travel at slow speeds \u2014 up to 25 miles an hour \u2014 while gathering data on pedestrians and human drivers; they are also starting to drive at night, and in rain and snow. <br>   <br> By 2019, Driver-assistance features will get more sophisticated, and will sync up with GPS and navigation. So a driver should be able to input a destination while driving on a highway, turn on adaptive cruise control and let the car drive itself. When it gets to the appropriate exit, the car will return control to the driver. <br>  <br> In the USA, NHTSA (NATIONAL HIGHWAYS TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION) has begun working on rules for testing and deployment of fully autonomous vehicles, without a driver, across the country. In the meantime, companies like Google will be racking up miles to gather data about every single type of situation a self-driving vehicle might encounter; mapping companies will gather as much 3D data in major cities as possible. Car makers and tech companies will have to make sure light detection and ranging (lidar) and radar sensors, as well as cameras and GPS, can work together, while ensuring that each component can function independently if one of them fails <br> . <br> Companies will also be testing vehicles in all climates and environments, including rain and snow. They'll also test cars in more places, moving from test tracks and low-density cities to roads with more foot and vehicle traffic.  <br>   <br> Commercial trucks will likely be the first vehicles to hit the road autonomously, if state and federal regulators give them them the go-ahead to work on highways.  <br>   <br> Here is one such article on the legislation making rounds in the Congress for federal rules on self driving cars to supersede state and local regulations : <br>   <br>  <a href='https://www.wired.com/story/congress-autonomous-self-driving-car-regulations/' target='_blank'> https://www.wired.com/sto... </a> ", "real_date": "04-07-2017", "real_time": "10:44AM"}, {"real_time": "02:09PM", "flag": 1, "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhGewF4Xyo0&feature=youtu.be", "created_time": "2017-07-02T08:39:19+0000", "short_message": "<b>Metakgp shared Kharagpur Open Source Society - KOSS's post.</b> <br>  <br> Whenever Apple releases a new version of the IPhone, a vast majority of users", "source": "Metakgp", "read_more": 1, "pic": null, "id": "1433721693547904_1858387001081369", "message": "<b>Metakgp shared Kharagpur Open Source Society - KOSS's post.</b> <br>  <br> Whenever Apple releases a new version of the IPhone, a vast majority of users will flock to buy the current version, although previous versions are still well in use.

Fondly remembered by many students and admirers. <br>  <br> Amherst - Madhukar Anant Rege passed away at age 92, on September 20th, 2016, after a long illness and a long, full life on three continents. <br>  <br> Born in Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast of India, he had a happy, active childhood. From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning. <br>  <br> It was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning. <br>  <br> In 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty. <br>  <br> He was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness. <br>  <br> He leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States. A great loss to us all, but a life well lived. <br>  <br> Beers and Story Belchertown Funeral Home has been entrusted with the arrangements.", "real_date": "28-09-2016", "story": "The Scholars' Avenue shared Director IIT Kharagpur's photo."}, {"id": "156819310131_10154446039510132", "read_more": 1, "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14522773_10154446039510132_1088846360209754607_n.jpg?oh=295a16d4ca340dffca86d62654e047e3&oe=5860DE0D", "flag": 1, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.294184150131.193021.156819310131/10154446039510132/?type=3", "created_time": "2016-09-28T13:26:26+0000", "short_message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.", "source": "The Scholar\"s Avenue", "message": "Technology Transfer Group, IIT Kharagpur is conducting a patent drive, the launch event  to which will be held on 29th September 2016 in SN Bose Auditorium.

Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise. The hall and department wise data obtained from the Electric Office unveils that the consumption has increased drastically in almost every hall and department. <br> Many a times we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness. We should always remember that there are still 19,706 villages in our India (Data as of 2015, Census Board, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India) which remain un-electrified even after 69 years of our independence.
