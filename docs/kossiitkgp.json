You can find a lot of GSoCers from KGP[3] over there, so don't hesitate.\n\nWe had mentioned about FLOSS Manuals[4] for the students. You must give this a read. It is written in a very simple and lucid manner and is one of the most useful resources for you right now.\n\nYou should also give a light read to a classic article on How to Ask Smart Questions[5]. And this is not just for GSoC !\n\nAnd finally, here are a bunch of resources for you to learn Git[6], which you would be using later.\n\nEmail us or ask on KLUG slack for any help that we can provide.
