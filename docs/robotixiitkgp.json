2018-2019.\nLet's take a quick revisit through the year right from the induction program up until the fest Kshitij.\n\nINDUCTION PROGRAM\nAs the very first interaction with the incoming fresher's batch, the induction program saw a lot of participation and enthusiasm to learn the basics needed to make their very own bots.\nThe participants took away useful knowledge which they later used for other Robotix events, along with a fun-filled time!\n\nINTRO SEMINAR\nThe intro seminar, meant to educate the freshers about the kind of technical and managerial work that Technology Robotix Society does and to give an insight into the culture of robotics here at IIT KGP, was conducted and received a great response from the freshers who were very excited to get a chance to handle the bots themselves.\n\n#robotix_recap", "story": "Technology Robotix Society is with Vamsi Krishna and Saswata Banerjee.", "link":
