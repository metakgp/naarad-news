It may be as small as some sensors or some tools. If yes then please let us know through Facebook. For those who are not aware of the Makerspace initiative, it is a community-based open source hardware hacking lab to make prototypes of selected hardware implementations as well as a meeting ground for open software projects. \nWho knows what the next gen may do with these, maybe the next great innovation just needs a little help from your side.\nWe received the first contribution in the form of a 3D printed robot with a 2-DOF arm from Shubh Agrawal, a fifth year undergraduate student of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Shubh has been a part of multiple robotics related activities on campus including AGV and Inter IIT Tech Meets.

Envisaged to be one of the largest hackathons globally, MoveHack is focused on 10 themes and structured over three legs: online, followed by Singapore leg, and the finals in New Delhi.\n\nMoveHack aims to bring about innovative, dynamic and scalable solutions to problems pertaining to mobility. The hackathon has a two-pronged campaign approach: \n(a) \u201cJust Code It\u201d: aimed at solutions through innovations in technology/product/software and data analysis, and \n(b) \u201cJust Solve It\u201d: innovative business ideas or sustainable solutions to transform mobility infrastructure through technology.\n\nMove Hack is open to individuals of all nationalities, making it a truly global hackathon. Registrations are open at https://www.movehack.gov.in. The top 30 teams from the online submissions will travel to Delhi to participate in the Final Round to be held in New Delhi on 5 and 6 Sep 2018.\n\nThe winners will be announced during the Move Summit 2018, which is also organized by NITI Aayog on 7 and 8 Sep 2018 in New Delhi (http://movesummit.in/) and is being inaugurated by the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister of India.
