In addition to this, student inventors from IIT Kharagpur who have realized novelty through their BTP and MTP theses will also be feted during the event.\n\nDon't miss this wonderful opportunity, and make yourself available at the Benjamin Gupta Auditorium, Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law, on 26th February at 5 pm sharp!", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/53074143_2542256315789388_4253536349245669376_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=ee162e17d06b1201c1e4f8d7cbae3dbb&oe=5CF2AD96", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/TSG.IITKharagpur/photos/a.898820073466362/2542256309122722/?type=3", "created_time": "2019-02-23T11:52:14+0000"}, {"id": "149405445074499_2530322320316121", "message": "Aerospace giant Airbus has finally pulled the plug on its A380 Program, 13 years after the 'Superjumbo' took to the skies and left travellers, onlookers and enthusiasts awestruck.

It is really very irritating when judges for the internal dramatics competition ask for their payment. If you ppl don't have proper managements and budgets why did you assure the judges for the payment within 10days after competition???? They all are having busy schedule. Moreover they made some time for the kgpians. I must say that they are all professionals having their busy schedules. Its really irritating when one of the judges (My friend)  asks me about it, and he needs the money urgently. What to say??? Is it really shows \" KGP ka tempo high hai???!!!\"  This s creating very worst and negative impact of kgpians. \nLastly pls guys pls sort these things asap.

The SIH was primarily a code-fest in which software programmers were challenged to write programmes giving innovative solutions to more than 500 problem statements. The SIH-2017 elicited an enthusiastic response with more than 40,000 students participating. It was concluded in the first week of April 2017 with Hon\u2019ble PM addressing the participants. This is being followed with Smart India Hackathon-2018 which was formally launched details of which can be found in https://innovate.mygov.in/sih2018/.\n\nThe MHRD now proposes to expand the scope of SIH-2018 by including hardware section in it. This platform will provide an opportunity to the innovative minds to showcase their solutions at the national level. It is also proposed that the best entries at the national level would also be provided funding through the Research Parks and the Technology Business Incubators (TBIs) for product development for their eventual commercialisation/extensive social use.\n\nThe MHRD expects a good participation in this Hackathon from all the IITs and NITs.\n\nAll students are requested to provide ideas (with or without models/prototypes) that will be proposed as problem statements of the Smart India Hackathon 2018. This should be done by mailing the idea totech.gymkhana@gmail.com by 13th November, 2 AM.\n\nYou are also requested to go through the 400+ problem statements provided in the aforementioned link and register for the Hackathon.
