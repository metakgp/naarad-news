Students\u2019 Alumni Cell is here to give you an advantage in the same via the second edition of its Alumni Career Assistance Program. This initiative endeavours to help final year students sitting for placements by allotting them an alumnus who is placed in the same company they wish to be placed in, just few years back. The alumnus will guide the student at every step of the tedious procedure of placements and act as a rock solid support when the student seeks help.\nThis would be a great way to build a resourceful connection during what is probably the most important time of a student\u2019s career and also to tighten relations of the Institute with its beloved alumni.   \nRegister at - http://www.sac.iitkgp.ac.in/acap.php\n(Exclusively for students sitting through the CDC procedures)", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/42742070_2385359854837567_4251981721408372736_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&oh=e5349eda111118c1f5a0743f4b88bb96&oe=5C55A23C", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/iitkgp.alumnicell/photos/a.670092513030985/2385359848170901/?type=3"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=161281734754714&set=p.161281734754714&type=3", "story": "Gayatri Roy added a new photo to Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur's timeline \u2014 at Maharashtra.", "created_time": "2018-09-08T01:02:04+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/41193939_161281738088047_4507979196932292608_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&oh=fa5fb1e17890ef21b1995d243081e296&oe=5C60ACE9", "id": "121094537930788_2348320931874793"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=161281734754714&set=p.161281734754714&type=3", "story": "Gayatri Roy added a new photo to Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur's timeline \u2014 at Maharashtra.", "created_time": "2018-09-08T01:02:04+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/41193939_161281738088047_4507979196932292608_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&oh=fa5fb1e17890ef21b1995d243081e296&oe=5C60ACE9", "id": "121094537930788_2348320931874793"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=161281734754714&set=p.161281734754714&type=3", "story": "Gayatri Roy added a new photo to Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur's timeline \u2014 at Maharashtra.", "created_time": "2018-09-08T01:02:04+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/41193939_161281738088047_4507979196932292608_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&oh=fa5fb1e17890ef21b1995d243081e296&oe=5C60ACE9", "id": "121094537930788_2348320931874793"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=161281734754714&set=p.161281734754714&type=3", "story": "Gayatri Roy added a new photo to Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur's timeline \u2014 at Maharashtra.", "created_time": "2018-09-08T01:02:04+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/41193939_161281738088047_4507979196932292608_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=10ef9515dcbe5a1488ac82fe555a5577&oe=5C391FE9", "id": "121094537930788_2348320931874793"}, {"id": "121094537930788_2343690385671181", "created_time": "2018-09-05T08:48:08+0000", "message": "\u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941 \u0917\u094b\u0935\u093f\u0902\u0926 \u0926\u094b\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u0916\u0921\u093c\u0947, \u0915\u093e\u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093e\u0917\u0942\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u0901\u092f \u0964 \n\u092c\u0932\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941 \u0906\u092a\u0928\u094b, \u0917\u094b\u0935\u093f\u0902\u0926 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u094b \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e\u092f \u0965\n\"If God and my Teacher were to stand before me, who would I first greet?\nI will choose my Teacher; for it was through his teachings that I saw God.\"\nMan is nothing without knowledge and there is no knowledge without a teacher.
