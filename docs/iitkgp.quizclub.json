This was the first time in three years that such an event was held, and needless to say, the first years did not disappoint. Never had we seen such a bumper turnout of 78 teams, with the levels of enthusiasm being off the charts.\n\nAfter an engaging prelims, we were able to select the top 8 teams into the finals, with the cut-off at 15/26. Shoutout to Team Box(Dewang Gogte, Rashil Gandhi, Shikhar Mohan) and Team Thundering Typhoons (Pratyaya Bhattacharya, Arusarka Bose, Saswata Banerjee) who narrowly missed the cutoff at 14.5 and 14 respectively.
