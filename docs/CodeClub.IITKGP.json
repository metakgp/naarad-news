Nurture.AI. We are pleased to inform you that Nurture.AI will be conducting AI Saturdays in Kharagpur. As we all know, that Artificial Intelligence is the new talk all over the world; why should Kharagpur stay behind! In this exciting initiative,  open and free for all AI sessions will be conducted in Kharagpur. This will be conducted in sync with a worldwide audience across the United States, Singapore, and other Indian cities. Each session every Saturday will be divided into 3 parts where we will implement AI algorithms, discuss research papers, online material and have some interesting discussions. \n\nThe session will have a preliminary understanding of Python as a must and here are some resources to help you with that:\nhttps://www.dataquest.io/  for a good guided Python introduction explanations and exercises: (Intro to Python available on free plan)\n\nPython refresher + numpy+ matplotlib by Stanford (https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb)\n\nPandas tutorials(https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas)\n\nWe are very glad to be a part of this and hope you too will benefit from this initiative. \nThe first session will be in January(tentatively on 13th January). All those interested kindly fill the registration form given below. The details regarding the sessions will be shared with the registered students soon.
