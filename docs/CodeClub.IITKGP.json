Nurture.AI. We are pleased to inform you that Nurture.AI will be conducting AI Saturdays in Kharagpur. As we all know, that Artificial Intelligence is the new talk all over the world; why should Kharagpur stay behind! In this exciting initiative,  open and free for all AI sessions will be conducted in Kharagpur. This will be conducted in sync with a worldwide audience across the United States, Singapore, and other Indian cities.
