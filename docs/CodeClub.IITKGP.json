Moreover, it also provides a set of practical algorithms\nto both estimate the dimensionality of the latent space of opinions and infer where opinions expressed by the participants of an online discussion lie in this space. Experiments on a large dataset from Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Sports, and the Newsroom app show that many discussions are multisided, reveal a positive correlation between the complexity of a discussion, its linguistic diversity and its level of controversy, and show that our framework may be able to circumvent language nuances such as sarcasm\nor humor by relying on human judgments instead of textual analysis.\n\n*Speaker Bio*: Manuel Gomez Rodriguez is a tenure-track faculty at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. Manuel develops machine learning and large-scale data mining methods for the analysis, modeling and control of large social and information systems. He is particularly interested in the creation, acquisition and/or dissemination of reliable knowledge and information, which is ubiquitous in the Web and social media, and has received several recognitions for his research, including an Outstanding Paper Award at NIPS\u201913 and a Best Research Paper Honorable Mention at KDD\u201910 and WWW\u201917. Manuel holds a BS in Electrical Engineering from Carlos III University in Madrid (Spain), a MS and PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, and has received postdoctoral training at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.
